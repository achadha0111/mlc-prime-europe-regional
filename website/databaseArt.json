    "description": "Millais\u2019s painting represents the drowning Ophelia from Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet. Driven mad with grief after her father Polonius was murdered by Hamlet, her lover, she allows herself to die by falling into a stream. The flowers she holds are symbolic: the poppy means death, daisies innocence and pansies love in vain. The painting was regarded in its day as one of the most accurate and elaborate studies of nature ever made. The background was painted from life by the Hogsmill River in Surrey. Elizabeth Siddall posed for Ophelia in a bath of water kept warm by lamps underneath.",

The original, which is now lost, consisted of a standard urinal, laid flat on its back and signed with a pseudonym, \u2018R. Mutt 1917\u2019. This work is one of a small number of replicas which Duchamp authorised in 1964, based on a photograph of the original by Alfred Stieglitz.",

Few works exemplify this perception better than Hockney\u2019s depictions of Californian swimming pools. These evoke a glamorous and exotic life of sun and leisure. Frequently, Hockney populates these scenes with male figures but here only the splash suggests a human presence. The painting also reflects Hockney\u2019s concern with capturing in paint transparent materials and transient moments.",

In the following four months, Warhol made more than twenty silkscreen paintings of her, all based on the same publicity photograph from the 1953 film Niagara. Warhol found in Monroe a fusion of two of his consistent themes: death and the cult of celebrity. By repeating the image, he evokes her ubiquitous presence in the media. The contrast of vivid colour with black and white, and the effect of fading in the right panel are suggestive of the star\u2019s mortality.",

Unable to embrace the watery image, he pined away, and the gods immortalised him as a flower. Dal\u00ed shows this metamorphosis by doubling a crouching figure by the lake with a hand clutching an egg, from which the narcissus flower sprouts. When this painting was first exhibited it was accompanied by a long poem by Dal\u00ed. Together, the words and image suggest a range of emotions triggered by the theme of metamorphosis, including anxiety, disgust and desire.",

They fly-posted their first posters overnight in the fashionable New York art district of SoHo, and have also displayed their work as advertisements on city buses. Over the years their attacks on sexism have widened to other areas of social, racial and gender-based inequality. The Guerrilla Girls wear gorilla masks for public appearances and use the names of famous deceased artists and writers as pseudonyms.",

The Surrealists valued the mysterious and provocative effect of such unexpected conjunctions. Dal\u00ed, in particular, believed that his objects could reveal the secret desires of the unconscious. Lobsters and telephones had strong sexual connotations for him, and he drew a close analogy between food and sex. He made Lobster Telephone for Edward James, the British collector who was the most active patron of Surrealist artists in the 1930s.",

The potency of the moonlight contrasts with the delicate vulnerability of the flickering lantern, emphasising nature\u2019s power over mankind and the fishermen\u2019s fate in particular.

His mother poses, attentive and graceful, while his father, who fidgeted during sittings, was painted reading Aaron Scharf's book Art and Photography. A book on Chardin draws \r\na parallel with intimate domestic scenes of the past, as do the volumes of Proust's Remembrance of Things Past visible on the shelf. Piero della Francesca's Baptism of Christ (now in the National Gallery; \r\nsee below) is reflected in the mirror, forming a triptych with the two figures.",

Instead he set out to make it as it was conceived, accepting that it would similarly change to some extent with the passage of time. Rather than simply working from photographs of the completed work, Hamilton used the notes and drawings of The Green Box to closely follow Duchamp\u2019s original process of creation. By doing this, thirteen years of work were compressed into nearly as many months. As Hamilton recalled after finishing the project, \u2018mental effort was exerted only in the direction of detective work, deductions from signs marking a path to be followed \u2013 the creative anguish was erased from the trail\u2019. When Duchamp came to London for the opening of his exhibition in 1966, he agreed to sign the reconstruction and the four glass studies produced by Hamilton, inscribing on the back \u2018pour copie conforme\u2019 (\u2018for a faithful replica\u2019).",

Her reconfigured features may reflect the complex atmosphere of the final weeks of the Nazi Occupation of Paris. Deprivation and tension remained high in the city. In February two of Picasso\u2019s closest Jewish friends \u2013 the poets Robert Desnos and Max Jacob \u2013 had been deported. Yet there were also signs of defiance and hope: in March, Maar took part alongside Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir in a clandestine performance of Picasso\u2019s play Desire Caught by the Tail, directed by Albert Camus.",

Like the holes in some of his other canvases, they have the effect of drawing the viewer into space. In some, however, the punctures erupt from the surface carrying the force of the gesture towards the viewer in a way that is at once energetic and threatening. Although these actions have often been seen as violent, Fontana claimed \u2018I have constructed, not destroyed.\u2019",

He began this work with a brightly coloured, predominantly red composition divided vertically into four sections. He then drew paint across the canvas using long batons edged in flexible plastic. By over-painting, scraping and scratching into the surface he destroyed the previous composition and created a new painting. Richter has stated that abstract paintings \u2018visualise a reality which we can neither see nor describe but which we may nevertheless conclude to exist\u2019.",

This work is one of a series that he undertook in the summer of 1960, using the superimposed numbers 0 to 9. Johns let the process of painting the number sequence dictate the structure of the painting. This allowed him  to concentrate on the qualities of the paint itself, exploring colour and thickness. The result is a highly abstract structure, but one rooted firmly  in the real world.",

The book upon the table and the writing materials in her hand suggest that she is a writer. Angelica Kauffmann\u2019s interest in classical portraiture and history painting was nurtured during her time in Italy during the 1760s. Kauffmann, who was Swiss by birth, settled in England in 1766, remaining there until 1781, when she departed once more for Italy. In England Kauffmann specialised in decorative history painting and small scale portraits of female subjects, such as the one shown here.",

We don\u2019t know whether this painting was inspired by an actual shipwreck, or the reissue in 1804 of a famous poem on the theme by William Falconer. Turner defines the essence of such an experience through overwhelming impressions of realism and horror. The dark tonality, characteristic of Turner\u2019s early paintings, provides a foil to the white crests and swirls of the waves.",

In the late 1970s, she devised nearly 300 aphorisms or slogans, which play on commonly held truths and clich\u00e9s. Initially, the Truisms were infiltrated into the public arena via stickers, T-shirts and posters. Later, Holzer started using electronic displays. In 1982 she  blazed these messages across a giant advertising  hoarding in Times Square, New York. The Truisms are deliberately challenging, presenting a spectrum of often-contradictory opinions. Holzer hoped they would sharpen people's awareness of the 'usual baloney they are fed' in daily life.",

The model was Cissie Barnes, the sixteen year old daughter of a fisherman from Newlyn, the Cornish village that was home to Dod Procter for most of her working life. The popularity of this painting led to its being displayed in New York, followed by a tour of Britain from 1927 to 1929.",

The Norwegian dealer Harald Holst Halvorsen secured as many as possible, including The Sick Child, and returned them safely to Oslo. Thomas Olsen bought the painting in 1939 and gave it to the Tate. Norway fell to the Germans in 1940. Looking back, Olsen explained that his gift was stimulated by \u2018my knowledge, from talks with Munch, that he felt the need of recognition in Western Europe, especially so after the advent of Hitler.\u2019",

Here Sutherland transforms the Palmeresque evocation of an Arcadian idyll into a more pagan image, replacing traditional Christian symbolism with animistic forces. The sense of brooding drama seen here was developed in Sutherland's landscape paintings of the late 1930s and  early 1940s.",

He abandoned representative images in favour of what he called Suprematism in 1915. In these works he used severely reduced geometrical forms \u2013 most famously a black square on a white canvas \u2013 whose meditative quality served as secular equivalents to Russian icons. He soon moved towards greater energy in paintings such as Dynamic Suprematism in which forms pull and push without relying on any reference to the physical world.",

They saw an artistic renewal as part of the  revolution and embraced new scientific theories  and industrial materials. A method known as  'stereometric construction' was central to Gabo's  work, by which form was achieved through the  description of space rather than the establishment  of mass. He declared in 1920: 'we take four planes  and we construct with them the same volume as of  four tons of mass.' In 1915-20 Gabo used planes to  construct heads and figures that demonstrated the  application of this method to traditional  subjects. 'Head No.2' is a later enlargement of  the most dramatic of these models.",

Over the next 26 years, until his death in 1976, he produced hundreds of variations on the basic compositional scheme of three or four squares set inside each other, with the squares slightly gravitating towards the bottom edge. What may at first appear to be a very narrow conceptual framework reveals itself as one of extraordinary perceptual complexity. In 1965, he wrote of the series: \u2018They all are of different palettes, and, therefore, so to speak, of different climates. Choice of the colours used, as well as their order, is aimed at an interaction - influencing and changing each other forth and back. Thus, character and feeling alter from painting to painting without any additional \u2018hand writing\u2019 or, so-called, texture. Though the underlying symmetrical and quasi-concentric order of squares remains  the same in all paintings \u2013 in proportion and placement \u2013 these same squares group or single themselves, connect  and separate in many different ways.\u2019",

At an early age, he wrote fake medieval histories and poems, which he copied onto old parchment and passed off as manuscripts from the Middle Ages. The fraud was later discovered. In London he struggled to earn a living writing tales and songs for popular publications. Penniless, he took his own life by swallowing arsenic at the age of 17.",

The model is Jane  Burden who became Morris's wife in 1859, and also  appears in Rossetti's 'Proserpine' displayed  nearby. She was 'discovered' by Morris and  Rossetti when they were working together on the  Oxford Union murals, the subject matter for which  was also taken from Malory. The painting is  essentially a portrait of her in medieval dress.  It is a splendid expresion of the intense medieval  style prevailing in Rossetti's circle in the late  1850s, with its emphasis on pattern and historical  detail. This is Morris's only completed oil  painting.",

The extraordinary costumes he created for himself played on fashion, fetishism and carnival aesthetics, which transformed his sixteen stones of flesh into an androgynous spectacle.Freud met him in 1988 and for four years painted him regularly. He was fascinated by Bowery\u2019s bulky physique and his awareness of the body as a sculptural object. In this painting, Freud shows him close-up and naked. The vulnerability of the sleeping figure lends the painting a touching intimacy.",

Nash explained that various elements were symbolic: the self-regarding hawk belongs to the material world, while the spheres reflected in the mirror refer to the soul.

He sought to create his own version of this solitary meditative experience, scaling his pictures so that the viewer is enveloped in their subtly shifting, atmospheric surface.",

Sargent admired the way  that Monet worked out of doors, and imitated some of his subjects and methods in sketches such as this. It is characteristic of Sargent to  give a human view of Monet's practice and  of the patience of his wife, who sits behind  him. When he settled in London in 1885 Sargent  was initially viewed as avant-garde, but came  to be the greatest society portraitist of his day.",

She applies the same frankness to the lives of her close friends. Goldin is attracted to the glamour of the world of drag-queens and transvestites. In Jimmy Paulette and Taboo! Undressing, NYC 1991, two men are caught in the midst of their gender transformation. Characteristically, this moment of exposure is presented with candour and empathy.",

In this work, made in mid-1909, Picasso used planes of warm greys and burnt sienna to establish the bulk of the body. The shifting directions of the brushstrokes indicate the depth of the surfaces and enhance individual features such as the conical socket of the eye. Such techniques were inspired by African sculptures. The poet Andr\u00e9 Salmon described Picasso\u2019s studio as filled with the \u2018strange wooden grimaces...

Ernst often re-used found images, and either added or removed elements in order to create new realities, all the more disturbing for being drawn from the known world. The work\u2019s title comes from a childish German rhyme that begins: \u2018The elephant from Celebes has sticky, yellow bottom grease\u2019. The painting\u2019s inexplicable combinations, such as the headless female figure and the elephant-like creature, suggest images from a dream and the Freudian technique of free association.",

Although unlikely to have been painted outdoors, from nature, this canvas is included to show how Turner used his rolls of canvas, and how the Cowes sketches would have looked before they were separated. The canvas bears three sketches of sea and sky, one of which was painted upside down so that one sky serves for two subjects if the canvas is turned. It is exhibited with two seascapes the right way up.",

There is no separation between me and what I photograph.' The self-portrait Nan one month after being battered was taken to prevent Goldin from forgetting the damage caused by her boyfriend's violence. She applies the same frankness to the lives of her close friends. Goldin is attracted to the glamour of the world of drag-queens and transvestites. In Jimmy Paulette and Taboo! Undressing, NYC 1991, two men are caught in the midst of their gender transformation. Characteristically, this moment of exposure is presented with candour and empathy.",

Using vivid, apparently  arbitrary, colours, Matisse has captured the  sensation of sunlight striking the sitter's face  and casting a heavy shadow down one side. He has  also tried to create a dynamic but balanced  relationship between complementary colours, such  as blue and orange, red and green. Complementary  colours 'complete' each other: they are at their  most intense when placed together. Matisse  adjusted his colours to obtain the maximum  intensity. This non-naturalistic use of colour can  be seen as a radical development of certain  aspects of Impressionist art, and it led the  critics to dub Matisse a 'fauve' (wild beast).",

After rolling the canvas out on the floor, he would apply the paint - usually industrial enamel paint \u2013 with sticks and basting syringes, which he wielded \u2018like a giant fountain pen\u2019, according to his wife, Lee Krasner.",

Written out, the crescendo is slowed down, as viewers are forced to read the narrative in a steady manner. Banner acknowledged this, observing that \u2018when it\u2019s translated into words \u2026 [the scene] becomes this kind of shaggy-dog story ... the opposite of keen imperative momentum.\u2019",

This work, in which streams of black and white enamels were poured onto the surface, shows  the improvisatory possibilities of this method.  The sweeping arc of Pollock's gesture can be  seen in the liquid black, which has bled into the white painted background to become grey. This acts as a base over which the thicker white paint is deliberately woven. The effect is rhythmic but controlled, energetic but delicate. Although there was an element of chance, Pollock frequently emphasised the importance of decisions over  the merely accidental.",

Strongly-coloured and freely-handled, this painting is characteristic of fauvism in creating vivid effects through bold contrasts of colour.",

The composition is full of elements that imply criticism of  the French colonial wars in Indo-China and North Africa, the continuing nuclear threat and the exploitation of the underprivileged.

There is no separation between me and what I photograph.' The self-portrait Nan one month after being battered was taken to prevent Goldin from forgetting the damage caused by her boyfriend's violence. She applies the same frankness to the lives of her close friends. Goldin is attracted to the glamour of the world of drag-queens and transvestites. In Jimmy Paulette and Taboo! Undressing, NYC 1991, two men are caught in the midst of their gender transformation. Characteristically, this moment of exposure is presented with candour and empathy.",

After this visit athletic male bodies, often combined with water, became \r\na recurrent theme in his work. These paintings often derive from images in magazines. Hockney has said: 'For an artist the interest in showers is obvious: the whole body is always in view and \r\nin movement, usually gracefully, as the bather is caressing his own body. There \r\nis also a three hundred year old tradition of the bather as a subject in painting.'",

Drawing on contemporary feminist thought, and in particular on psychoanalysis, it explores the contradictions for a woman artist between her creative and procreative roles. The work, says Kelly, traces the differences between 'my lived experience as a mother and my analysis of that experience'. To make these panels Kelly recorded and then reflected on a number of conversations with her son, before finally allowing him to scribble across her carefully documented texts.",

The work was reported as having been painted in six weeks. It is the only life-size female nude the artist ever painted. Millais had some difficulties in resolving the problems associated with such subject matter. Initially he painted the woman looking towards the spectator. The unpleasant effect this created led him to repaint her head looking away. An 1893 magazine article noted that 'for delicacy's sake' he placed the knight behind her.",

A book traditionally alludes to excessive pride through learning, and a wine jug to temporary pleasure. The skull is a memento mori, or reminder of death. Picasso was superstitious about death and kept a skull in his own studio, which appeared in a number of his works. Made on 20 February 1946, this print is inevitably associated with the widespread suffering caused by the Second World War.",

In the 1930s she  had pierced abstract forms, introducing light and  transforming their sense of mass. Even the  substantial 'Image II' (weighing more than 400 kg)  appears effortlessly lightened as a result of its  undercutting, its concavities and the penetrating  hole. Hepworth explained: 'I believe that the  dynamic quality of the surfaces of a sculpture can  be increased by devices which give one the  impression that a form has been created by forces  operating within its own mass as well as from  outside... the piercing of mass is a response to  my desire to liberate mass without departing from  it.",

This painting was  originally the right-hand part part of a triptych.  The left-hand part of the triptych was called  'Line of Force + Landscape' and the central one  'Lines of Force + Noise'. The theme of the  triptych was the passage of a car along a white  road, with green and blue forms, evoking earth and  sky, in the background.

The lengths of fabric gathered around the shelves are shroud-like and also evoke the curtain of the crematorium. Aside from this suggestion of 'memento mori' the harsh beams that spotlight each face evoke references to interrogation and torture. These aspects together with the sheer scale of death suggested by the title and by the repetitive presentation employed here have led commentators to find references to the holocaust. However by nominating the victims as Swiss, a neutral people, the association is muted and allows for more intimate, personal and wider, historical reflections.",

    "description": "In 1924 the poet Andr\u00e9 Breton published the first Manifesto of Surrealism. The primary aim of this literary and artistic movement was, he explained: 'to resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality.' Inspired by the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud's theory of the unconscious, Surrealism used irrational images to portray the working of the human mind. Max Ernst's Piet\u00e0 or Revolution by Night is typical. The painting replaces the traditional scene of Mary clasping  the body of Christ with an image of the artist himself, held by his father. A staunch Catholic, Ernst's father had denounced his son's work, and the painting is often seen as rising out of their troubled relationship, although - like dreams - it resists precise analysis. Other Surrealists included the poets Paul Eluard and Louis Aragon, and the artists Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Salvador Dal\u00ed and Joan Mir\u00f3. Purges and defections meant that by 1939 the strength of the group had dissipated. However, it was not formally disbanded until 1968.",

Over the next 26 years, until his death in 1976, he produced hundreds of variations on the basic compositional scheme of three or four squares set inside each other, with the squares slightly gravitating towards the bottom edge. What may at first appear to be a very narrow conceptual framework reveals itself as one of extraordinary perceptual complexity. In 1965, he wrote of the series: \u2018They all are of different palettes, and, therefore, so to speak, of different climates. Choice of the colours used, as well as their order, is aimed at an interaction - influencing and changing each other forth and back. Thus, character and feeling alter from painting to painting without any additional \u2018hand writing\u2019 or, so-called, texture. Though the underlying symmetrical and quasi-concentric order of squares remains  the same in all paintings \u2013 in proportion and placement \u2013 these same squares group or single themselves, connect  and separate in many different ways.\u2019",

This painting was one of the first of Romney\u2019s numerous portraits of Hart, which often represent her as characters from myth and literature. Hart sat many times to Romney in the summer of 1782, after she had become the mistress of the aristocratic politician and collector Charles Greville (1749\u20131809), moving into his home at Edgware Row, Paddington. She later married Sir William Hamilton, Greville\u2019s uncle, and became the mistress of Admiral Lord Nelson.",

Many critics of the period believed the artist aimed to represent reality in a new, almost scientific manner. However, as this atmospheric painting shows, Picasso could use this technique for expressive ends. Here, the woman has been all but stripped of her humanity and appears strangely mechanistic. At the same time, Picasso demonstrates his awareness of tradition in her pose and in the play of light within the picture.",

While the scene here could represent a memory of folk festivals or 'festas', it also has a more profound symbolic meaning. The dance can be read as a dance of life, representing the stages from a girl's childhood to old age. The rhythmic movement of the figures contrasts with the stillness of the setting, suggesting the balance between perpetual change and the essential  continuity of existence. Rego's painting has an eerie, dream-like quality typical of her work, which often refers to childhood fears and fantasy. The work can be considered a memorial to Rego's husband, the artist Victor Willing, who died during its completion.",

Turner has chosen the biblical Deluge as the vehicle for these ideas, returning to the Historical Sublime he had mastered in some of his earliest exhibition pictures. Originally painted and framed as octagons, this pair carries two of Turner's last and most inspired statements of the natural vortex, while the allusion to Goethe adds a gloss of recent science and theory to a lifetime's preoccupation with elemental forces.",

In October and November of that year Picasso depicted his studio twelve times. The room is empty but Picasso\u2019s presence is strongly felt in his tools and the sculpted head on a modelling stand. The studio had been a favourite subject for his friend and rival Henri Matisse, and it has been suggested that this series was a direct response to the artist\u2019s death the previous year.",

    "description": "An early example of Mondrian's pure geometric abstraction, this painting dates from his involvement with the De Stijl group. The strict use of horizontal and vertical lines and primary colours with black and grey is characteristic of De Stijl. Mondrian's aim to evoke a spiritual equilibrium was influenced by the mysticism of Theosophy, which sought universal order. He had been working with chequerboard grids before he began this painting, which introduced greater variety. He told van Doesburg: 'now I do not always keep to the proportional division'.",

The bath, cut off at both ends, and the structure of the wall create a rigorously geometric composition. The effect is strangely lifeless, and almost tomb-like; as if the painting were a silent expression of sorrow for Marthe's plight.",

However, the massiveness of her limbs  and her immobility appear to echo earlier antique  art, or later Roman copies of Greek models. The  ambiguity and potential for irony in this  admixture of references were essential elements in  Picasso's approach to the art of the past.

    "description": "Constable made full-size sketches like this for many of his six-foot paintings. They allowed him to explore his ideas before committing them to the final canvas. The finished picture in this case was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1829. The composition originated in a minute drawing Constable made on a visit to the ruins of Hadleigh Castle in Essex in 1814, but this painting was not developed until around the time of his wife\u2019s death in 1828. The resulting image of loneliness and decay is now often seen as exemplifying his desolate state of mind at the time.",

In titling this work The Annunciation, Magritte may have been alluding ironically to the hostility towards Catholicism shown by the French surrealists.

This highly topical scene is given an added poignancy by the fact that it was stimulated by the emigration of Thomas Woolner, a fellow Pre-Raphaelite, who left for Australia in July 1852. The focus of the picture is the tragedy of exile for the middle-class couple (modelled by Brown and his wife), a theme reiterated in Brown's writings: 'The educated are bound to their country by quite other ties than the illiterate man, whose chief consideration is food and physical comfort'. This watercolour is a replica of an oil painting now in Birmingham.",

For a few years after Palmer moved to the Kent village of Shoreham in 1826, he found the local landscape perfectly matched these Blakean visions. Blake, too, in a rare  trip out of London once briefly stayed in Shoreham. This work is partly painted in tempera, as were some of Palmer's other Shoreham works.

The artist exerted considerable control over the picture, posing the girl in the attitude of Manet\u2019s Lola de Valence 1862, and designing her dress in detail.\n\nThe portrait demanded over 70 sittings each lasting several hours.  Cicely recalled: \u2018I used to get very tired and cross, and often finished the day in tears.\u2019  Not surprisingly, the picture was criticised for its departure from the more informal formats usually adopted for child portraiture.  One critic called it \u2018a disagreeable presentation of a disagreeable young lady\u2019.",

They are composed of simple geometric shapes and  relate, as the name suggests, to Cubist painting  and sculpture. In 'Cubi XIX', and a number of  related pieces, the forms on the cross beam are  arranged rather like a still life, though elevated  by the vertical beam. Smith intended the 'Cubi'  works to be shown outside, so that the burnishing  of the stainless steel would reflect changes in  lighting conditions. The geometric forms were  softened by this response to the environment as  Smith anticipated in a note on a sketch: 'polished  - like I feel if I make square clouds'.",

His concentrated study of familiar items enabled him to develop a new way of capturing his visual sensations.

In this painting, he combined several viewpoints of the fat-bellied jug and fruit. Like many of his works, it was left unfinished.",

Magnetic coils attached to the screens cause the image to jump and warp, disrupting the footage. By subverting the broadcast material, Paik transforms television into a two-way, participatory medium. The choice of Nixon as subject underlines the authoritarian and manipulative nature of the state-controlled broadcast image. The installation was conceived by Paik in 1965, and realised in its current form in 2002."

In these works Louis poured lines of pure colour across the bottom corners of the painting, leaving the centre bare. This became known as the 'one-shot' technique because the artist had only one attempt at a successful pour. If the line went astray there was no second chance. These lines stress the painting's flatness, leading the eye across and out of its surface. This again denies any reading of the painting as an image to be looked into, and insists on its reality as non-representative object.",

Typically his paintings evolved from real elements, such as photographs of people and places, together with his memories of them. These were then developed imaginatively through engagement with the paint itself. This painting of the artist and his daughter is based on a photograph of them swimming together. Andrews developed this image so that it also refers metaphorically to Melanie's transition from family life to society.",

    "description": "Brothers Jake and Dinos Chapman have been a vital, if controversial force in British art of the 1990s. Disasters of War was their first major collaborative project. It is characteristic of their confrontational and visceral approach to themes such as death, violence and sexuality. Gruesomely detailed, it is  a three-dimensional reworking of Disasters of War,1810-13, a portfolio of etchings by Spanish artist, Francisco Goya (1746-1828). The toy-like scale of the Chapmans' work at first appears to undermine the epic notion of war, yet in fact gives a strange intensity to the horrors of battle.",

Van Gogh spent the last few months of his life there, from mid-May 1890, when he left an asylum, to his death on 29 July. At the beginning of June, Van Gogh wrote to his sister: 'there are some roofs of mossy thatch here which are superb and of which I shall certainly make something'. This picture, which is unfinished, was probably begun soon afterwards. Painted direct from the motif, it shows how Van Gogh transformed what he saw into something entirely personal, using a vigorous brushwork and curving outlines to express an unsettling vitality and energy.",

In contrast to their pre-war counterparts, the mannequins in this work have a flesh-like solidity, while their grouping echoes traditional scenes of the Holy Family. The easel and painting stick appear to refer to the artist's belief in the importance of old-fashioned technical skills. However, de Chirico's attitude towards tradition and the past was always ambiguous and ironic. The building fragments that emerge from the mannequins' stomachs, for example, seem vaguely classical but also suggest a child's building blocks.",

However, she is probably best known for her collages, influenced both by artists such as John Heartfield and by the transgressive sensibilities of the British punk scene in which Linder was immersed. Subverting a banal advertising shot of a couple embracing, the woman in this collage appears to be using an oversized fork to gouge out her eyes. The jarring image suggests a darker side to the fantasy of a picture-perfect romance.",

The nude model, Hetty Pettigrew, provides the key element in Roussel's bold pictorial design. Her diagonal placing effectively cuts the square canvas in half, creating equal areas of light and dark. Roussel uses naturalistically painted detail  to decorative effect. The luminosity of the model's skin tone is echoed by the peach fabric of the kimono, and is dramatically opposed to the  blackness of the setting. In the opinion of Roussel's contemporary, the painter Sir William Orpen, this  was the finest nude painting of his time.",

Whereas Johns had taken a familiar object - a target - and executed this motif on the canvas in a painterly style, Blake took this further by using a real archery target purchased from a sports shop. The work of art is consequently less like a painting and is even closer to the real world. Blake thus questions: is this 'the first real target'?",

The painting is more complex than it seems: it is built up with delicate layers of paint against a rich black ground.

Wearing challenges social stereotypes and assumptions, and often works in collaboration with members of the  public as a means of 'interrupting the logic of photo-documentary and snapshot photography.'

This surprising flower painting by Picasso reveals a lot about the tastes of the Tate Gallery Trustees in the early twentieth century. In 1933 Picasso was already an established avant-garde artist, but the decision to buy this conservative early work shows that the Trustees were resisting the more radical developments in modern art.",

Hervey, his back to the viewer, is seen in the foreground of the picture. At the foot of the stair which winds heavenward to God, sits a widow with the bodies of her husband and children.

For  Francis each colour has a symbolic value: white  corresponds to the infinite, blue to the cosmos  and water, and yellow to the sun.

He also described how his view of the sky changed with the threat of aerial bombing during the war. Rose of Death, his first picture of the war, was of a parachute. Perhaps this image of clouds metamorphosing into a white magnolia flower relates to the expected end of the war. As a spiritual symbol it recalls the imagery of William Blake.",

Though such works  have been seen in terms of child-like fantasy,  they also reveal the artist's interest in the satirical paintings of the German artist George Grosz.  The vigour of the deathly dance is made chillingly absurd by the decay around the skeletons. The scene is full of references to death, not least  the dangling figures silhouetted against the  sky, which recall photographs of hanged rebels  in Africa which Burra saw in the Belgian cultural magazine Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s.",

Responding to such examples, her compositions became more simplified, her use of colour more vibrant. During this period she also made a small number of wholly abstract paintings like this one, characterised by blocks of bold colour.",

In line with his usual practice, Auerbach constantly drew, erased and reworked the image. The final image is therefore built upon numerous previous attempts. In this way the portrait is saturated with the artist's accumulated experience of the model. As a result of this long process the paper became torn and abraded and necessitated the patch visible in the drawing.",

The players take turns to draw part of a body onto a piece of paper, which has been folded horizontally to hide what the other players have drawn. The result is a body of composite parts. These etchings feature comic-horror imagery typical of the Chapmans\u2019 work: skulls, eyeballs on stalks, grotesque animal heads, liquids dripping and spurting from wounds, orifices, nipples and heads, writhing intestines, and claw-like hands and feet.",

The exaggerated colours in this painting, contrasting yellow-orange flesh with blue water, emphasise the nudity of the figures. The original effect, however, may have been too extreme, as Kirchner repainted parts of the picture in 1926, making the colours lighter and the surface of the painting more even.",

He has transferred the dimensions of the billboard and a visual style reminiscent of advertising into a fine art context. The combination is highly unsettling, simultaneously encouraging and undermining recognition in the viewer. The scale creates  an unreal space that situates us both within and outside the picture, as if it were a room  that could be entered.",

In the completed painting, Rossetti shows the Damozel looking down on her beloved from Heaven; this is the scene shown here. Rossetti\u2019s fascination with the separation imposed by death proved eerily prophetic when his wife Elizabeth Siddall died of an overdose of laudanum in 1862.",

It was probably this that led Krasner to call the painting Gothic Landscape, several years after completing it. Krasner was married to the artist Jackson Pollock and, during their life together, her work was eclipsed by his rise to fame. Gothic Landscape was made in the years following his death from a car crash in 1956. It belongs to a series of large canvases whose violent and expressive gestural brushstrokes reflected her feelings of grief.",

His facial features, although always identifiable, also act as patterns of densely layered colour.

Despite his poor health, he  apparently painted these works with great energy,  moving his whole body, not just his wrist. His  sweeping brushstrokes are clearly visible in the  two rectangles of colour which make up this  painting. It has been said that Rothko placed the  darker colour at the top of the painting in order  to prevent it being read as landscape, a reference  which he wished to avoid. The white border, which  was left by the tape Rothko used to fix the paper  to a board when painting, was for him an integral  part of the work.",

It was developed from Gabo's unrealised project for the lobby of the Esso Building in New York in the late 1940s. Two sculptures similar to 'Linear Construction No.2' were designed to be located on top of the two revolving lobby doors, turning slowly. It was one of Gabo's favourite works and was presented to the Tate in memory of the art historian Herbert Read.",

Monet paid for them to be left standing long enough for him to paint them. In all he executed twenty-three paintings of this scene, and exhibited a group of them together in 1892. Eleven of these show this same view at different times of day and in different weather conditions. A particularly marked feature of this work is its combination of a strong surface pattern, emphasised by vigorous brushwork, and the suggestion of pictorial depth conveyed by the continuous zig-zag of trees leading back into the distance.",

He said its combination of \u2018beauty, ugliness and the power to disquiet\u2019 held a \u2018strange fascination\u2019 that was a form of \u2018natural surrealism\u2019.",

This emphasis was related to new ideas about living and, especially, to modern architecture, in which natural light and formal simplicity were major concerns.",

Unfortunately the malignancy was not excised and Spencer died on 14 December 1959. Five months before his death he stayed with friends in Yorkshire where he painted this portrait. Although seriously ill he finished the picture in five days, in the drawing room of the house, using a bedroom mirror. The work is remarkable for the unflinching scrutiny of the artist's gaze, and its use of extreme close-up to convey a sense of physical and psychological intensity.",

Although the sitters frequently appear together, they rarely seem to interact, either with each  other or their surroundings.

    "description": "This is one of three paintings by De Kooning titled Women Singing. They were based on pop singers the artist saw on television. The energetic style and vibrant colours are typical of De Kooning''s work of the 1960s. Interviewed by Sylvester a few years earlier, he spoke of the authority that he felt he had achieved in his painting. ''I have all my forces ... I have a bigger feeling now of freedom. I am more convinced ... of picking up the paint and the brush and drumming it out.''",

This painting is of a farm near Keswick in the Lake District where the newly-wed Carrington spent a summer holiday with her husband and their friends, including Gerald Brenan, with whom she developed a mutual attraction. It has been suggested that the two female figures, dwarfed by a fertile and undulating landscape, relate to the artist\u2019s sense of being overwhelmed by her own womanhood.",

In the right-hand corner is a shape that could be either the woman's outstretched hand, or a face in profile looking over her.

The images of Elizabeth II were based on a photograph taken for her Silver Jubilee in 1977. Warhol presents the Queen as an iconic and overtly glamorous figure. His own lines, added to the photographic image, suggest the stylised make-up of a Hollywood star, associating the portrait with the cult of celebrity that was prevalent in the 1980s."

    "description": "At a time when many artists were abandoning traditional sculptural techniques, Penone began to use perhaps the most ancient method \u2013 carving. He took industrially sawn units of timber and, using chisels, followed the knots in the planks to remove rings of wood and expose the shape of a tree. His work looks at the relationship of industry and nature, suggesting that a sensitive approach to materials is still possible in an industrialised world. Penone\u2019s first trees were made in 1969 and this work dates from 1980.",

The figures combine human attributes with animal or bird-like features. Appel thought of them as \u2018people of the night\u2019, and so gave them a dark background. The bright colours and child-like imagery are typical of CoBrA.

Although never a Surrealist, his paintings incorporated disconcerting imagery that related to the work of de Chirico. Widely travelled, Wadsworth was better informed than most British artists about developments in the Continental art world. In the early 1930s he joined Unit One, a group of artists and architects who were determined to bring Modernism into British culture.",

Instead he explored Venice\u2019s unique combination of water, light and grand Renaissance architecture, all of which seem to blend together.

    "description": "In the 1950s, Duchamp made a small number of moulded objects, based on the\r\nbody\u2019s sexual parts. They exemplify his fascination with sexual\r\nambiguity. Female Fig Leaf was probably based on a mould of\r\nthe sexual parts of the female mannequin in Duchamp's installation Etant Donn\u00e9s(Given). The prudish title, Female Fig Leaf, is deliberately ironic. despite its phallic appearance\r\nand the fact that the French word \u2018dard\u2019 is slang for penis, could\r\nalso derive from the cast of a vagina. It therefore embodies inside-outside,\r\nmale-female dualities. Wedge of Chastity is the smallest of the three. The\r\nmetal \u2018wedge\u2019 and the slit-form can also be seen as expressing the\r\nunion of male and female shapes. Duchamp made the original version of the\r\nsculpture in 1954 as a wedding present for his second wife. It is reported that\r\nthe couple kept it displayed on a bedside table and travelled with it,\r\n\u2018like a wedding ring\u2019.",

It has been described as \u2018the most profound and literary work of the entire Old Testament\u2019. \n\nIn \u2018Job\u2019, God and Satan discuss the limits of human faith and endurance. God lets Satan force Job to undergo extreme trials and tribulations, including the destruction of his family. Despite this, as God predicted, Job\u2019s faith remains unshaken and he is rewarded by God with the restoration of his health, wealth and family. Here Blake shows Satan torturing Job with boils.\n\nFrom The Holy Bible (King James version), Book of Job, Chapter II, 3-10\n\n3.\tAnd the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.4.\tAnd Satan answered the Lord, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.5.\tBut put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.6.\tAnd the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.7.\tSo went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.8.\tAnd he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.9.\tThen said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.10.\tBut he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.",

The choice may have been in response to the death of Turner\u2019s father in 1829, suggested by the unusual treatment which is both tender and menacing. Death appears, not as a triumphant, upright figure astride his horse, but as a phantom emerging from a turbulent mist: his skeletal form, arms outstretched, and draped submissively over the horse\u2019s pale back. Such disturbing visions were considered to embody the very concept of the Sublime.",

This later work is a sculptural figure constructed using nine vintage Bakelite radios, which the artist acquired from thrift stores and markets. Bakelite was an early heat-resistant plastic that was commonly used for domestic electrical goods and childrens\u2019 toys in the 1930s and early 1940s. Paik has customised the radios to incorporate specially compiled video footage. Their archaic quality harks back to an era when global communications technology was just beginning to become part of everyday life."

However Lavater also suggested that in performing an evil act the person could become disfigured, perhaps explaining Cain\u2019s contorted body. \n\nRather than follow Lavater here, Blake\u2019s use of the body to invoke self-loathing, fear and, in the case of Eve, despair may be closer to pathognomy - a way of reading emotions about which Lavater remained sceptical.",

The bold directional marks in this painting also have a strong architectural sense, and it has been suggested that the work relates to an engraving of a clock tower by the nineteenth-century French artist Charles Meryon. Despite the spontaneous feel of his work, Kline often made small preparatory sketches before executing the larger paintings.",

This is a reference to Boothby\u2019s pride in having published the first volume of the Swiss philosopher\u2019s autobiographical Dialogues in 1780. In deference to Rousseau\u2019s ideas, Boothby seems to shun the \u2018civilised\u2019 world to think deeply, alone with nature.",

Increasingly, however, he saw literal depictions of mythic subjects as inhibiting the viewer\u2019s response. Describing the biomorphic forms in paintings such as this, he wrote: \u2018every shape becomes an organic entity, inviting the multiplicity of associations inherent in all living things\u2019.",

His peregrinations act as drawings that inscribe physical or metaphorical marks into the landscape. When Long brings natural materials into the gallery environment he places them in simple,geometric arrangements, as here with red slate from the border of Vermont and New York State. This configuration emphasises the tension between conceptual structure and organic matter. Long stated: \u2018A circle outdoors focuses our attention on the environment it is in, while indoors the circle and materials demand the attention.\u2019",

The image  is somewhat abstracted due to the elimination of  certain details and the way the remaining areas  appear as disconnected shapes and marks. Such  passages echo abstract paintings of the period.  Nevertheless, the centre of the image can be read  as a voluptuous woman, identifiable by her red  lips and diagrammatic bra, seen caressing a  gleaming car. These elements were derived from, or  inspired by, adverts and popular imagery, themes  which preoccupied Hamilton and other artists  associated with the Independent Group in London.",

Emphasising a continuous tradition of political activism, Bowers recreated the image on sections of cardboard boxes, using a permanent marker pen. She had seen similar materials used to construct placards by twenty-first century protestors such as the Occupy Wall Street encampment. She also altered some of the text on Crane\u2019s banners to reflect more recent political campaigns."

The German critic Will  Grohmann, for example, saw the figure as a  'fashionable lady, who is spite of her striking  elegance is more or less helpless in face of the  oppressive spirits'. In the Bauhaus where Klee  taught in this period the work was known, he said,  as 'The English Miss'. Others emphasise the erotic  connotations of the imagery, and Klee's use of  arrows as phallic symbols. For Christain Geelhaar  the 'young lady's adventure' referred to in the  title is sexual in nature.",

The sun is sinking below the trees to the left, which cast long shadows across the lawn at the back of the house. Above them hovers a flight of rooks.

It is a sign of their modernity that Vanessa Bell and her Bloomsbury Group friends holidayed there. This is one of several works by Bell from 1911\u20132 which show a debt to Matisse in their simplified design and bold colouring. Though an exercise in what her friends, the critics Clive Bell and Roger Fry, called \u2018significant form\u2019 (emphasising colour, shape and line rather than subject matter), the picture retains some of the feel of a sunny day by the sea.",

Claudio\u2019s awkward pose draws attention to his prison shackles. The apple blossom blown by the wind at his feet symbolises his readiness to buy his own reprieve with Isabella\u2019s chastity. Her white habit emphasises her purity. Holman Hunt summarised the moral of his picture as: \u2018Thou shall not do evil that good may come.\u2019",

The titles are not meant to be descriptive, but refer merely to associations connected with the artist\u2019s visits to London. Since 1980 Richter has made his abstract paintings by manipulating spatulas of different lengths, loaded with paint, across areas of the canvas. New layers of colour cover earlier ones. Richter\u2019s inability to control the precise distribution of paint allows a degree of chance to determine the paintings\u2019 final appearance.",

Lowry's combination of observation and imaginative power often produced images which capture a deeply felt experience of place, with which others could identify. For example, in 1939 John Rothenstein, then Director of the Tate Gallery, visited Lowry's first solo exhibition in London and later wrote: 'I stood in the gallery marvelling at the accuracy of the mirror that this to me unknown painter had held up to the bleakness, the obsolete shabbiness, the grimy fogboundness, the grimness of northern industrial England.'

This might explain why the man seems to grin instead of crying out in shock.

This selection of five images shows the range of responses which Wearing elicited  from passers-by, whom she selected  at random, and asked to write their thoughts on a piece of paper. Wearing challenges social stereotypes and assumptions, and often works in collaboration with members of the  public as a means of 'interrupting the logic of photo-documentary and snapshot photography.' She has said 'A great  deal of my work is about questioning handed-down truths.'",

As a result of anti-Catholic legislation Wright was exiled from London to Dublin in 1679, where this work must have been painted. Sir Neil (?1658\u20131690) is shown in the richly ornamented costume of an Irish chieftain. Beside him is an Irish wolfhound, a valuable breed of dog whose export from Ireland was forbidden in 1652. At his feet is a rare suit of Japanese armour. This may be seen as a trophy representing victory over persecutors of Catholicism, among whom the Japanese were notorious at the time.",

Younger, avant-garde artists tended to concentrate on still life and landscape in the twenties using them as vehicles for formal experiment. Only three early abstract paintings by Nicholson are known and all of them display evidence of a sophiscated understanding of Cubism and its insistence on shallow space and overlapping planes. This painting was very advanced in the context of British art in this period, where the notion of abstraction was essentially equated with the distortion of natural appearance.",

It belongs to a celebrated series of pastels of women at their toilette produced in the mid-1880s, a group of which was included in an exhibition of Impressionist painters in Paris in 1886. Critics varied in their reactions to these works. Some praised the way Degas showed plausible, modern women rather than idealized goddesses. Others complained of the models' ugliness and suggested they were prostitutes. In this pastel, however, there are no indications of the woman's social class or line of work.",

He painted the border on the canvas, but the frame is much later in date.",

He was entirely self-taught, and had begun life as a railway clerk. He was much influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites, but gradually moved towards a more ethereal evocation of light and atmosphere reminiscent of Whistler.",

The thick texture of white correction fluid gives it solidity, while the graph paper, of the type used by architects, adds to the impression of three-dimensional space.

Police used powerful fire hoses to break up the march, injuring many of the young protestors. Gates has arranged strips of decommissioned fire hoses to resemble the composition of a 1960s American abstract painting \u2013 a form that pointedly failed to engage with the Civil Rights movement. Gates also questions whether the protestors\u2019 goals have been fulfilled. \u2018Some of us are slightly better while others are a great deal better\u2019, he has reflected, \u2018but\u2026 things are far from equal\u2019."

This is one of his last paintings of trees and is based on realistic sketches made in the Netherlands. After settling in Paris and absorbing the influence of Cubism, Mondrian reworked the image almost to abstraction. The trunk and branches are condensed to a network of verticals and horizontals. He acknowledged the inspiration of nature but added, \u2018I want to come as close as possible to the truth, and abstract everything from that until I reach the foundation of things\u2019.",

Trained in interior design and architecture, Vordemberge initially made reliefs and sculptures. By 1923, he wrote, he 'started making deliberate use of colour' in making paintings. This is one of his earliest paintings and exemplifies what he called 'Absolute art'; namely art without content or object. Colour, form, contrast and space were the only objects.",

    "description": "In 1950, at the age of 62, Albers began what would become his signature series, the Homage to the Square. Over the next 26 years, until his death in 1976, he produced hundreds of variations on the basic compositional scheme of three or four squares set inside each other, with the squares slightly gravitating towards the bottom edge. What may at first appear to be a very narrow conceptual framework reveals itself as one of extraordinary perceptual complexity. In 1965, he wrote of the series: \u2018They all are of different palettes, and, therefore, so to speak, of different climates. Choice of the colours used, as well as their order, is aimed at an interaction - influencing and changing each other forth and back. Thus, character and feeling alter from painting to painting without any additional \u2018hand writing\u2019 or, so-called, texture. Though the underlying symmetrical and quasi-concentric order of squares remains  the same in all paintings \u2013 in proportion and placement \u2013 these same squares group or single themselves, connect  and separate in many different ways.\u2019",

Since the relative inaccessibility of the location made it difficult to transport heavy materials, he used steel tubing and beams. These lighter materials reflected his concern at the time with non-monumental sculpture. Caro's work was becoming increasingly linear, enclosing space in cage-like constructions. The opening to the left creates the sense of an internal space, which is penetrated and activated by the tubes and rods.",

Twombly uses strong colours to suggest the brilliant Mediterranean light and the essence of the different seasons, from vivid red and yellow in spring to deep greens and purples in autumn, combining these smears and drips of paint with scrawled poetic fragments, reminiscent of ancient graffiti, from several sources. While the lush, tactile qualities of the paint evoke bodily sensations, the poetry grounds these feelings in the broader context of classical culture. The curved forms that are visible in Primavera and Estate evoke traditional Egyptian rowing boats, imagery that appeared in Twombly\u2019s work after he spent several months in Egypt during the mid 1980s.",

McLean\u2019s poses are an ironic and humorous commentary on what he considered to be the pompous monumentality of Henry Moore\u2019s large plinth based reclining sculptures. The artist was photographed repeating the poses from his performance. The plinth in McLean\u2019s work also functions as an ironic reference to its dogmatic rejection as a legitimate base for sculpture by Anthony Caro and others teaching at St Martin\u2019s School of Art when McLean was a student there between 1963 and 1966.",

She adopts masculine gestures  and stances, and shows herself in unisex clothing like jeans and T-shirts. These images also raise questions about the  role and appearance of the modern  artist. In contrast to the clich\u00e9 of the  artist as an anguished male, Lucas  shows herself as an ordinary person  in emphatically ordinary surroundings.",

This picture  belongs to a group entitled 'Revenge', which  proposed black women's voices as alternatives  alongside those of white men. Here she reuses the  title of an etching by the Victorian artist James  Tissot, which shows a Highlander seated in a boat  between two women, but focuses on the women.

In such paintings, the artist was more concerned with asserting a sense of glamour and sophistication than conveying individual personalities. The woman on the left is shown playing a French-made guitar, the latest fashion to arrive from Paris.",

Stott devotes considerable attention to the arrangement of the closely observed flowers and vegetation. This kind of detail appealed to more conservative elements of the British art world, such as the Royal Academy, where Stott frequently exhibited.",

The objects are made by assistants according to LeWitt?s instructions. By minimising his physical presence in the process of fabrication, LeWitt emphasises the impersonality of these structures.",

Gordon is fascinated by dualities and the tension between good and evil. The excision of eyes in this work may suggest an unknowable alter-ego hidden behind the polished veneer of the portrait.",

Reviewing an exhibition of war art at the National Gallery in October 1941 Piper wrote, 'after a war the controlled emotional record of actual events - the record made at once from experience and in the heat of the moment - is the only one that counts'. The watercolours he made in Bath provided the occasion for making such a record. They are the first to achieve the theatrical lighting effects typical of his work.",

Visual reflections and rhymes are abundant in all three works. The bulbous body of the carafe in Bowl of Fruit echoes both the apple in the centre and the circular rim of the glass on the right, while the geometrical edges of the fruit bowl itself seem to reverberate across the folds of the tablecloth. In Pipe and Domino the spots of the domino, the bowl of the pipe and the rim of the small dish constitute an expanding series of circles. In Still Life with Guitar, the echoing ovals of the mouth of the carafe and the opening of the guitar offset the linear patterns of the sheet music and guitar strings. In addition, a deliberate spatial contradiction allows the fruit to nestle in the curve of the guitar as if in a fruit bowl, creating a sensory link between vision, taste and sound.",

He completed a number of paintings of the beach there that are among the most authentically Impressionist works produced in Britain. Here he captures the rich warmth of late afternoon sunlight but, unlike the French Impressionist Monet, he was just as interested in the figures as in their setting. Steer has reworked the dashed, broken colour of the paint surface extensively. The two girls were originally holding hands, and in their shadow they still are. This kind of picture was seen as uncompromisingly avant-garde. One critic in 1892 even described such works at the New English Art Club exhibition as 'evil'.",

Alternatively, you may think that his picture robs these workers of their individuality and denies the harsh realities of work for sentimental effect.",

The most famous was the Cenotaph, designed by Edwin Lutyens, in London\u2019s Whitehall. Jagger became one of the leading memorial sculptors.

    "description": "In the early 1830s Turner was a regular visitor to Petworth, the Sussex house of his patron Lord Egremont. The house contained a fine collection of old master and contemporary British paintings, and many artists were entertained there. Turner used the Old Library as a studio. As well as painting the estate, he made many drawings of the house and its inhabitants and guests. The death of Egremont in 1837, and that of his other great friend and patron Walter Fawkes in 1825, increased Turner's social isolation in his later years.",

The subject for all three was Dante\u2019s La Vita Nuova which Rossetti translated for his own publication, The Early Italian Poets 1861. Rossetti was fascinated by Dante\u2019s story and saw in it a parallel with his own love for Elizabeth Siddall.

However, she omitted to ask for eternal youth and wasted away until only her voice remained. The poignant theme of her story is reflected in Turner\u2019s landscape. The passage of time has wrought changes to the Roman architecture of the resort, but the golden beauty of the landscape remains undiminished.",

In 1934 he opened  an art school there which he maintained until  1958. Hofmann was a highly respected teacher. The  degree of contact he had with European artists was  rare among contemporary Americans. Hofmann's own  art flowered after he closed down his school. His  late paintings are characterised by the  juxtaposition of strongly coloured rectangles.  These created the feeling of space because the  human eye sees different colours as being at  different distances from it. Hofmann termed this  effect 'push and pull'. The paintings were often  worked out by pinning rectangles of coloured paper  to the canvas.",

The size of the series was not predetermined. The prints do not tell a story but are a group of images which collectively depicts the fantasies of an artist in old age. Aware of his declining sexual potency, Picasso cast himself in the role of a voyeur. The series encouraged a widespread revival of interest in etching among contemporary artists.",

She began posing regularly for Auerbach in the early 1950s and by 1959 was the subject of over thirty paintings and drawings. This painting is one of three versions which Auerbach worked on between May 1957 and April 1958. The paint's thickness is the result of hundreds of sittings governed by Auerbach's principle that 'Nothing can be left out ... you have to bury the irrelevent in painting somehow'. The way the image seems buried in a dense accretion of paint thus records Auerbach's quest to find a visual equivalent for his 'raw experience' of the sitter.",

He began the painting in 1977 and it took  three years to complete. Freud recalls that it  provided a means of accustoming himself to the  light of a new studio.

The steel mesh suggests cloud, but it also alludes to the Benday dots used in the printing of comics and newspapers. However, the sculpture has no relation to that process and, indeed, the dots were barely visible in the original illustration. Made at a time when the USA was heavily involved in the Vietnam War, this sculpture can be seen as anaesthetising violence, turning a destructive explosion into a simplified icon of beauty.",

He had opposed the war since the 1960s but avoided representing it directly in his work, preferring to explore the themes of masculinity and power in a more universal manner. He changed his mind after the 1972 presidential election, in which the anti-war Senator George McGovern was heavily defeated by Richard Nixon. Golub used news photographs and his own experience as a veteran of the Second World War in order to build an allegory of the disconnection generated by conflict. Vietnam II sets American soldiers and their armoured car across a telling central gulf from Vietnamese civilian victims. The contrast between ruthless organisation and panicked disintegration find an echo in the apparently fragmentary nature of the work itself.",

A distinctive characteristic of Lowry's work is his use of a white background and the elimination of shadows which gives his pictures a naive and dreamlike quality. He started using pure flake white as a base for his paintings in the 1920s. This was a result of an argument with his teacher Bernard D. Taylor, who thought Lowry's pictures were too dark. Lowry later discovered, to his pleasure, that the flake white turned creamy grey-white over the years.",

To earn a living he abandoned his white reliefs of the 1930s and returned to painting landscapes, which his dealers Alex Reid & Lefevre considered easier to sell. Landscapes, particularly those of British scenes, became popular during the war. This view of the harbour at St Ives is one of a series begun in 1939. They enabled Nicholson to develop ideas of the previous decade, particularly his experimentation with the positioning of objects in space. He added the Union Jack in the foreground as a gesture to celebrate V.E. Day and the end of the war.",

In this statue group he depicts the moment in Greek myth when Hylas, the boy companion of Hercules, was abducted by water-nymphs who were entranced by his beauty. Hylas is simultaneously admired and restrained by the two Naiades. Gibson\u2019s treatment of the scene draws on many classical sources, and the marble is inscribed (in Greek) with the words \u2018Beautiful Hylas\u2019. The statue was bought by Robert Vernon, a successful businessman and patron of the arts, and subsequently given to the nation.",

For these he looked to classical precedents, photographs and such other sources as the plaster casts of the victims of Pompeii. These suffering male figures spoke, perhaps, to current Cold War anxieties and memories of recent warfare.",

However, it is now known that he meticulously copied the image of this work from a small preparatory drawing. The grid-like structure underlying the blue wash relates to the scaling-up of the initial drawing. Mir\u00f3 himself was a Catalan and may have chosen to represent the peasant with a red barratina cap to symbolise support for Catalan nationalism. Other elements in the painting are either ambiguous or mysterious, with the eyes, for example, also suggesting breasts.",

Incarcerated with his sons, Ugolino eats them to survive, although the act is futile and all eventually die. Here the vast, Arctic landscape remains impassive to a terrifying human drama.

More specifically, it grew out of the drawings she made of interlocking figures. This fusion of figures could be seen as  a symbolic expression of her interest in individual and social relationships. One writer described  such carvings as 'unmistakably archetypal',relating them to the ancient standing stones near Hepworth's home in Cornwall.",

The figure in the new image is derived from Oedipus and the Sphinx (1808), a neo-classical painting by Ingres, with Picabia\u2019s addition of a fig-leaf (the French say \u2018vine leaf\u2019) as a reference to censorship. The inscription DESSIN FRAN\u00c7AIS (\u2018French drawing\u2019) sarcastically mocked the contemporary revival of interest in traditional art skills.",

This is one of a series of reliefs in which the elements were planned using a precise mathematical formula and a module as the basic determining unit of proportion. New mass-produced materials, such as plastic and aluminium angle sections, create a sense of illusionist space through precision of design. Hill commented: \u2018Synthetic materials and other materials like glass and metal in their machine states gives the abstract artist a new and important group of media and it is with these materials that \u201cConstructionist\u201d conceptions can be realized and developed.",

All the other paintings of Mayo show her in an interior, this is the only canvas which depicts her nude in the open air. Procter produced numerous paintings of nude women and young girls during the decade 1925 to 1935 which were highly acclaimed for their objectivity and simplicity. What was, and still is, unusual is that these female nudes were painted by a female artist.",

Changing the colours at random intervals, he painted it one stretch at a time, first by brush, in oil paint, and then by overspraying with an emulsion of oil and egg. This yielded a line with two distinct textures, each immaculate. As with 'Fall', also in this display, the title of this work refers to the French writer Albert Camus. Cohen admired Camus's belief in stoical persistence combined with acknowledgement of life's absurdity. In his philosophical essay 'The Myth of Sisyphus' (1942) Camus relates how 'The Gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would roll back of its own weight'. Adapting a phrase from Camus's essay, this picture's title refers to the moment when the unbroken line returns to the bottom edge of the canvas, where it began.",

    "description": "Like many of Chagall's prints from the early 1920s  'The Vision' is based on an earlier work which  dates from 1917. After Chagall moved to Paris in  1923 he created new versions of many of the works  he had made in Russia. 'The Vision' depicts the  young painter at his easel being visited by an  angel. Chagall's paintings were often inspired by  his dreams, and the winged angel is only one of  many fabulous beings which people his compostions.  Chagall recognised that through his art he could  escape into his imagination. He later said  that painting 'appeared to me like a window  through which I could fly away toward another  world.'",

At night she would leave the  Imperial palace to voluntarily work in a brothel,  a journey which Beardsley depicts here. The design  was produced for an edition of Juvenal's 'Sixth  Satire', published by Leonard Smithers. Smithers  published a succession of erotic material in the  1890s, some of it illustrated by Beardsley.  Previously refuted or ignored, the female libido  was very much a topic of quasi-scientific and  religious debate in the 1890s, when opinion began  to acknowledge it for the first time. This  coincided with the beginnings of a reconsideration  of women's status in society.",

In this picture he shows a family of  field workers topping and tailing swedes for  sheep fodder. It was painted at Chilwick Green near St Albans, where the artist had moved in  1881. He uses subdued colouring to capture the dull light and cold of winter, and manages to convey the hard reality of country work. Such unromanticised scenes of country life were often rejected by the selectors of the Royal Academy annual exhibitions.",

As a result of this experience Riley's use of colour underwent a further major development and she evolved what she called her 'Egyptian palette'. This is characterised by colours of greater intensity than she had used previously, a development accompanied by her decision to change from acrylic to oil paint. At the same time she returned to using stripes as the basis of her compositions. As in her stripe paintings of 1967-73, Riley's use of the stripe format represents a desire to use 'unassertive forms' which allow the colours to establish the painting's structure.",

Figures overlap, seemingly merging into one another and collapsing any sense of perspective, a reflection on the importance of community and social relationships, shown here in meltdown. Three years before painting this, the artist had been imprisoned for eighteen months by the Portuguese secret police for his involvement in FRELIMO (the Front for Liberation of Mozambique)."

Several of his works explore feelings of uncertainty and anxiety that relate to Surrealism. The use of space in Three Points creates a sense of anticipation.

This sculpture is one of a group of small bronzes made by the artist during the early 1950s that focus specifically on the relationship between mother and child. During the Second World War Moore's interpretation of the theme emphasised the mother's nurturing role, a response to the human suffering of war. He continued to explore this aspect of the subject in the 1950s. Here he distorts the figures to suggest the submission of the mother to the aggressive needs of the child as it tries to suckle from her breast.",

They met while students at St Martin's School of Art in 1967. They have worked in the media of video, performance, painting, drawing and  photography. In 1970 they began calling themselves 'living sculptures' and, wearing conservative suits and striking statuesque poses, became the primary subjects of their art. Red Morning Trouble shows the artists in contemplative attitudes with red and black panels showing reflections in the river and modernist buildings along London's river bank. It is a picture of ordinariness, with the shirt-sleeved artists resembling city workers ready to step out into mundane life.",

Sargent had known her since childhood when their families had been neighbours in Nice, and she remained a friend all his life. This portrait sketch was painted in a single session lasting three hours. Sargent gave it to her, writing on it through the paint 'to my friend Violet'.From the late 1870s Sargent was amongst those artists trained in Paris who made Impressionism an international style, blended with the technique and attitudes of old masters such as Velasquez. In this sketch his free brushwork makes for a brilliant illusion, and suggests the ambiguity of this author who adopted a male name.",

Hiller's greatly enlarged photographs draw  attention to changes wrought by time and have a  powerful formal presence. The sound track, which  the viewer should listen to after looking at the  photographs, is crucial to an understanding of  work; it makes the viewer/listener an active  participant and an integral part of the  installation when seen by other spectators. Hiller  pioneered installation in the early 1980s. The  combination here of sound and image was  innovatory.",

Her draped black cloak, or mantle, embroidered (like her hat) with pearls in a pattern of ostrich feathers, has classical precedents. So does her partly bared breast, a feature seen in surviving drawings of masque costumes by the court designer Inigo Jones (1573\u20131652). Like the miniaturist Nicholas Hilliard, Peake originally trained as a goldsmith. From 1607, Peake was joint court painter to James I.",

Analysis of the oak panel and the pigments used, along with the style of clothes and design of the sword hilt, dates the work to around 1550.

Maillol worked on the three figures in plaster between 1931 and 1937. The group was cast in lead in 1938, and the edition size is thought to be six. Maillol preferred the material of lead for this group because he felt that bronze would be too dark in character for the flowery theme.",

Their targets include museums, dealers, curators and art critics. They fly-posted their first posters overnight in the fashionable New York art district of SoHo, and have also displayed their work as advertisements on city buses. Over the years their attacks on sexism have widened to other areas of social, racial and gender-based inequality. The Guerrilla Girls wear gorilla masks for public appearances and use the names of famous deceased artists and writers as pseudonyms.",

He shows it, in pictorial terms, as the triumph of light over darkness. However, he also includes a smaller snake emerging from the dragon\u2019s wound, perhaps hinting at the inescapable cyclical regeneration of brutal natural forces.",

He was an energetic promoter of abstract or non-figurative art, and helped to found international groups such as Art Concret and Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation. He believed that abstract art, however radical, shared timeless values of balance, rhythm and composition with the great art of the past. In this small painting he creates a compositional unity through the visual resolution of vertical and horizontal forms and colour relationships.",

Bourgeois made her first prints in the 1940s and, after a gap of about forty years, returned to printmaking in 1990. Frequently child-like in style, these works portray the events and fantasies of her childhood and adolescence. The scenes include the trauma of birth, the pubescent discovery of the body, the moulding of a daughter by her mother, and the stifling of a daughter by her father.",

In 1828 he was exposed as a quack, and following the death of two patients between 1830 and 1831, was found guilty of manslaughter. He managed to escape with a fine, and continued to practice as a doctor.",

His chosen subjects were views of London, mostly in the  St John's Wood, Hampstead, Kentish Town and Paddington areas. He was particularly fond of including a stretch of water in his compositions and often chose back-street views of canals, as here. He liked the slightly forlorn Regency and early Victorian terraces that faced the canals, and gave them a curiously uninhabited look. He once wrote: 'There is beauty to be found in everything, you only have to search for it; a gasometer can make as beautiful a picture as a palace on the Grand Canal, Venice. It simply depends on the artist's vision.'",

He is shown here as a huntsman with his kill, a possible reference to the ongoing Civil War. His patronage of the arts is indicated by the statue of Apollo and the classical frieze he is leaning on. Dobson painted this portrait at the exiled court of Charles in Oxford. The pose is taken from a portrait of the Roman Emperor Vespasian by Titian, which was then in Charles I\u2019s collection. Porter was later forced into exile in France.",

The frame is inscribed with the fourth verse which sets the scene for these episodes: Porphyro's approach to the castle, where a lavish banquet is in progress; his awakening  of Madeline from her dreams; and the lovers' silent escape from the dark castle into the night. The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy the same year  as Hughes's April Love. John Ruskin described it as 'A noble picture... the face of the awakening Madeline is exquisite'.",

The setting for this violent encounter is the harsh, rocky landscape of Creswell Crags in the Peak District.

A Newman-like composition of vertical stripes is altered by the intrusion of a stencilled map of South America. Bowling was born in British Guiana (later Guyana) and this was one of several images he used which referred to his home.

According to his son JG Millais, Millais\u2019s inspiration was \u2018the potent voice of the wood spirits\u2019. \n\nMillais\u2019s title comes from Tennyson\u2019s \u2018In Memoriam A.H.H.\u2019, 1850, written in response to the early death of the poet\u2019s friend Arthur Hallam. Millais may also have shared Tennyson\u2019s opinion that, though a work may be inspired by personal experience, its emotions are universal: \u2018\u201cI\u201d is not always the author speaking of himself, but the voice of the human race speaking through him\u2019.\n\nFrom Alfred Tennyson, \u2018In Memoriam A.H.H.\u2019, XI, 1850\n\nCalm is the morn without a sound,Calm as to suit a calmer grief,And only thro\u2019 the faded leafThe chestnut pattering to the ground:Calm and deep peace on this high wold,And on these dews that drench the furze,And all the silvery gossamersThat twinkle into green and gold:Calm and still light on yon great plainThat sweeps with all its autumn bowers,And crowded farms and lessening towers,To mingle with the bounding main:Calm and deep peace in this wide air,These leaves that redden to the fall;And in my heart, if calm at all,If any calm, a calm despair:Calm on the seas, and silver sleep, And waves that sway themselves in rest,And dead calm in that noble breastWhich heaves but with the heaving deep.",

Matisse wrote that the painting \u2018will represent me as well as possible - moreover, I think that it will not frighten the acquisitions committee of the Modern Museum in London.' In fact, the Tate initially turned it down, but accepted it in 1938.",

Confounding a prediction that he would no more become emperor than ride across the Gulf of Baiae with horses, Caligula constructed an artificial floating bridge of boats which he then crossed with a chariot. Turner has depicted the bridge as a solid construction. It has, however, like the adjacent palace, fallen into ruin and decay. The picture was widely admired in 1831.

His proposal  that Monument for an Airport could be used  to advertise Imperial Airways, as either a desk display or an outdoor sculpture, was never realised. Model for 'Torsion', however, was eventually translated into a large fountain outside St Thomas' Hospital in London. Gabo's increasing concern, from the late 1930s, with the aesthetic aspect of his work at the expense of the industrial can be seen in Model for 'Construction in Space \"Crystal\"'.",

He had a charismatic but self destructive disposition and possibly identified with James Dean, the Hollywood film star, who was killed in a car accident in 1955, aged twenty-four. By the early 1950s Minton's reputation was in decline. His commitment to figure composition seemed out-dated in the face of American Abstract Expressionism. 'The Death of James Dean' was his last ambitious picture. He was found dead on 22 January 1957. The coroner's verdict was suicide.",

At the time he lived very close to the boulevard de Clichy in Paris, and he was to make a number of paintings and etchings of the buildings and people on this busy thoroughfare. The painting can be seen as a quiet celebration of the metropolitan elegance of Paris, but its title shows that Goeneutte saw the wintry weather as important element in the composition. The artist admired Manet and was a friend of Renoir in this period. In later years, however, his choice of subjects and style were both relatively traditional.",

Hendricks was already a well-known African-American painter, and his decision to place a naked black male figure in the position of the traditional female \u2018odalisque\u2019 was extremely radical. As the title underlines, the painting confronts white fears and sexual stereotypes surrounding the black male. These issues are heightened by a realistic representational style that went against contemporary trends in black American art.",

In that year Moore bought a French book on pre-Columbian sculpture which included many illustrations of masks. During 1928-9 Moore made eight masks, four cast in concrete and four carved in stone. In this stone mask the eyes, nostrils and mouth are holes which have been drilled right through the material. This device of drilling a hole points to future developments in Moore's work because the sculptor came to believe that 'A hole can have as much shape-meaning as a solid mass.'",

    "description": "Butler's maquette was the winning entry in the international competition for a monument to 'The Unknown Political Prisoner'. After his original maquette was severely damaged, Butler made two replicas. This work was made between 1955 and 1956 and represents Butler's vision of a monument to 'The Unknown Political Prisoner' in its most fully developed form. Four times larger than the maquettes, it was welded from pieces of steel forged by the artist. It includes details such as the ladder-like structure which climbs one of the legs of the tower. Several leading Germans, including the mayor of Berlin were keen to see the monument built in West Berlin, although this ambition was never realised.",

He probably began each canvas in a specially adapted flat-bottomed boat, but would have continued working on paintings in his studio over a period of time. Monet has stripped this scene of physical detail, focusing, instead, on recording the all-enveloping light and atmosphere of the river. In 1891 he said, 'For me, a landscape does not exist in its own right, since its appearance changes at every moment; but the surrounding atmosphere brings it to life - the air and the light, which vary continuously. For me, it is only the surrounding atmosphere which gives subjects their true value.'",

The child shown sitting at the table is the artist's fourth son, Ludovic Rodolphe. Pissarro spent much of his life near Pontoise and several of his paintings depict the surrounding landscape and its inhabitants. In this picture he used the typical Impressionist device of cutting off objects at the edges of the painting, such as the table, chairs and the prints on the wall, in order to give the composition a sense of informality and immediacy. The small, feathery brushstrokes prefigure Pissarro's later Neo-Impressionist or Divisionist paintings.",

In these works, layers of lines, either static or mobile, produce an optical disturbance. In Cardinal a cascade of stems hangs in front of a striped background, gently swinging with the air around it. This movement is enhanced by the optical effects of the rods against the hand-drawn lines."

Describing his method, Lee wrote: \u2018Load the brush and draw a line. At the beginning it will appear dark and thick, then it will get gradually thinner and finally disappear ... A line must have a beginning and an end. Space appears within the passage of time, and when the process of creating space comes to an end, time also vanishes\u2019.",

As its title suggests, Dibbets wanted to 'correct' the recessive perspective of a large area of ground. He decided to use light coloured rope that would clearly mark off a cross shaped area of grass. He used much thicker rope for the two top, more distant, right-angles, so that they would appear to be in the same plane as those at the bottom of the photograph. The nearest right angles are approximately eight inches long, whereas those farthest away are each over thirty feet long. Grass was chosen because it did not have obvious perspectival references.",

On his return to London he worked in an  independent manner but was in close contact with  the British artists Henry Moore, Paul Nash and  Roland Penrose. The International Surrealist  Exhibition of 1936 made a significant impact on  him and, during 1939-40, he made a striking series  of carvings in wood and stone which he entitled  'The Complete Fragment'. These carvings were  mostly part or parts of the human head, greatly  enlarged and complete in themselves. McWilliam was  interested in the interplay between solid volume  and surrounding space in these works, and also how  the viewer completes the 'missing' parts of the  sculpture in the mind's eye.",

Here the kind of hand tools he customarily employed are brought together in an electrically-driven three dimensional collage. The appearance of movement and the beat are coordinated in a syncopated way so that the illusion of irregularity is created. The actions of the tools appear purposeful but are pointless in functional terms. Tinguely perhaps had in mind the obsolescence created by mechanical progress. This elegant work is animated by the colourful handles of the tools as well as by movement and sound.",

She adopts masculine gestures  and stances, and shows herself in unisex clothing like jeans and T-shirts. These images also raise questions about the  role and appearance of the modern  artist. In contrast to the clich\u00e9 of the  artist as an anguished male, Lucas  shows herself as an ordinary person  in emphatically ordinary surroundings.",

The British Public had followed the two-year conflict between Britain and Russia in the popular press; with this painting Collinson satisfied the demand for staged homecomings.A weary soldier wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards is returning home to his rural cottage. When it was first exhibited a quotation beside the painting explained that the soldier had been discharged because of an accident leading to blindness. As a consequence, the family now faced a bleak future.",

Several years later, after the collapse of CoBrA, Constant re-titled the work to reflect his disillusionment: \u2018I changed the title to express my doubts about the possibility of \u2018free art\u2019 in an unfree society, and, at the same time, my hopes for the freedom all men are looking for.\u2019",

Photographs of the artist's studio at that time show other small sculptures depicting men on ladders and ropes. The artist considers the large heads to have been an 'audience' for the 'human circus' suggested in the other works. Scale is an important aspect of Davies's work. He has added that the small figures always felt distant. In contrast, the large scale of the heads gave an impression of extreme proximity. As this work shows, enlarged scale also emphasises the physical presence of the subject.",

He also painted landscapes based on the surrounding area. Nicholson and Wood were impressed by the directness of Wallis's work, his use of irregular shaped pieces of cardboard as a support and ground, and the object-like quality of the paintings.

In  'Iberia', for example, you would have to know that  a Spanish bull ring is made of sand of an ocher  colour, and that Spanish bulls are very small,  quick and coal black'. This picture is 'an  equivalence of the ferocity of the whole  encounter'. Motherwell painted a series of elegies  for the Spanish Republic, which was defeated in  the Spanish Civil War. In these paintings, as in  'Iberia No. 2', black symbolised death and  anxiety. Here it threatens to engulf the land.",

Lear\u2019s doctor orders the musicians to play more loudly and awaken him. But Cordelia is anxious that her ailing father should sleep and she speaks the lament inscribed on the painting\u2019s frame. In the play Lear divides his kingdom between his other two daughters and their husbands. But, after a painful period of self-discovery, he realises that Cordelia is his only true loving child.",

Olitski's large scale canvases are covered in delicate mists of colour that give the works an all-over unity and a sense of continuation beyond the frame. The paintings have an ethereal quality, appearing to dematerialise the canvas surface. Olitski said he would prefer 'nothing but some colours sprayed into the air and staying there.'",

This bust was originally painted, reflecting Bourdelle\u2019s interest in the polychromatic sculpture of the ancient Greeks. Frazer himself wrote \u201cI don\u2019t know if in fact my face has all that gravity, all that philosophical profundity; but... I should be glad if after my death this portrait alone was kept and all the others destroyed\u2019.\n\nAntoine Bourdelle was born in Montauban, France, in 1861 and died near Paris in 1929.",

This aimed to  engage directly with reality through using  everyday artefacts rather than traditional art  materials. In the early 1960s C\u00e9sar made  sculptures from machine-crushed pieces of metal.  They were known as 'compressions'. From 1965 he  worked on a series known as 'expansions', and  experimented with what were for him new materials,  such as glass fibre and polyester resin. This  'thumb', made for an exhibition on the theme of  the hand, was based on a lifesize cast of his own  thumb, scaled up using the machines traditionally  employed by sculptors to enlarge their works.  C\u00e9sar made several, increasingly large versions of  this work.",

This composition was among the first works by Lewis to suggest the architectural and mechanistic rhythm of urban life using a distinctive abstract style. Vorticism challenged French Cubism and Italian Futurism, although its sharp-angled depiction of fragmented space owed a debt to these movements. However, Vorticism focused on the idea of the 'Vortex', the still centre where creative energy is most intense.",

The rock embodies many of the problems and  contradictions of modern tourism. At 348m  (1,143 feet) high, it is the world's largest monolith and a major destination for tourists. Historically, however, it is a sacred site for several Aboriginal tribes and its caves contain carvings and paintings. To evoke the site's spiritual dimension Andrews has adopted the anthropomorphic convention  of suggesting human forms in the land by  accentuating the mouth-like characteristics  of a gash in the mountainside.",

The relationship between body and land was of particular interest to Moore at this time since he had just completed a large 'Recumbent Figure' in green Hornton stone for the architect Serge Chermayeff's garden at Halland in Sussex. Stone could be carved to suggest cavities created by weathering; however, the medium of lead produced a different emphasis.

Here, Turner criticises again British non-intervention in the Belgian revolt, which was to lead to the termination in 1839 of the United Netherlands. In the Academy catalogue Turner added a curious note about the Prince having sailed his yacht, not a frigate - a confusion with his arrival in a yacht for his wedding to Princess Mary on 4th (!)

He also  related it to Moore's early interest in  Palaeolithic sculpture, an influence the artist  readily acknowledged. Moore wrote of the work:  ''Woman' has that startling fullness of the  stomach and breasts. The smallness of the head is  necessary to emphasize the massiveness of the body  - if the head had been any larger it would have  ruined the whole idea of the sculpture.'",

Despite the baffling absence of any church named San Benedetto, the view is an authentic Venetian prospect looking from the Giudecca Canal towards Fusina on the mainland.

This was most clearly expressed by John Ruskin who wrote that \u2018without one single accurate detail\u2019 it was \u2018the likest thing to what it is meant for ... of all that I have ever seen\u2019.",

After completing the drawing of all four directions I would have performed a symmetrical act.

Over the next 26 years, until his death in 1976, he produced hundreds of variations on the basic compositional scheme of three or four squares set inside each other, with the squares slightly gravitating towards the bottom edge. What may at first appear to be a very narrow conceptual framework reveals itself as one of extraordinary perceptual complexity. In 1965, he wrote of the series: \u2018They all are of different palettes, and, therefore, so to speak, of different climates. Choice of the colours used, as well as their order, is aimed at an interaction - influencing and changing each other forth and back. Thus, character and feeling alter from painting to painting without any additional \u2018hand writing\u2019 or, so-called, texture. Though the underlying symmetrical and quasi-concentric order of squares remains  the same in all paintings \u2013 in proportion and placement \u2013 these same squares group or single themselves, connect  and separate in many different ways.\u2019",

Historically, Edward's  final advance in 1283 preceded the building of  Caernarvon Castle. It is this earlier moment which  lies at the heart of Turner's landscape of  breathtaking savageness, paralleling that of the  advancing force. The archetypal image of the Bard  issuing his curse from the mountains above is  absent, although this is perhaps experimented with  on another sheet (shown adjacently).",

To create Two Junctions, Maekawa placed pieces of burlap, a textile used to make jute rice bags, onto a canvas, then cut, sewed and folded the material. He then poured and dripped coloured enamel paint over the textured surface, producing an abstract image that transcends the flatness traditionally associated with painting.",

He was  not allowed to paint in the Synagogue itself, so  took a room nearby and persuaded some of the men  to sit for him. Some of the models have been used  twice in the picture: the two standing men appear  to be the same person. Rothenstein was  himself Jewish, and painted several scenes of  contemporary Jewish culture in the early years of  the century. The picture was first shown at the  NEAC 1906 summer exhibition. Afterwards it went on  to the celebration of Jewish life in Britain held  at the Whitechapel Art Gallery. The picture was  presented to the Tate in 1907 by Jacob Moser to  commemorate that exhibition.",

This is one of several pictures on the theme of peasants travelling to or from market. These articulate a sense of nostalgia for the old ways of country life, where independent family units were able to support themselves by working the land. Here, a family is shown in a moment of rest after the labours of the day. The painting\u2019s rich colours and swelling forms evoke the example of the 17th-century painter Rubens, giving the scene a feeling of peaceful grandeur.",

However, he soon  realised he could not change her in every respect,  as she still chased mice. This work is one of a  hundred etchings executed by Chagall for  the 'Fables'. Vollard was criticized for not  commissioning a French artist, but he believed  Chagall shared the same aesthetic sense as La  Fontaine, 'being at the same time naive and  subtle, realistic and fantastic'.",

However, Einstein left to take up a professorship at Princeton before it was completed. Epstein later described Einstein\u2019s \u2018wild hair floating in the wind\u2019 and wrote that \u2018his glance contained a mixture of the humane, the humorous, and the profound. This was a combination that delighted me. He resembled the ageing Rembrandt\u2019.\n\nJacob Epstein was born in New York in 1880 and died in London in 1959.",

They show his precocious understanding of Cubism and Futurism, and of the artists who later became known as Vorticists. The subject was based on a scene of dockers working in the hold of a steel ship. A ladder, seen in the lower right of the picture, connects the hold with the deck above. The drawing is divided into sixty-four squares and a diagonal grid which produces a cross in each square. This geometrical framework, repeated in the final painting, dissolves the subject of the picture into dynamic angular facets.",

The pose of this figure is reminiscent of earlier carved portrait busts, but the abstracted treatment of the forms indicate Moore's interest in non-western art. In later life Moore wrote of his admiration for an Egyptian sculpture of a seated woman in the British Museum collections. He particularly enjoyed the way her head-dress was 'freed from the body so that you can look through its arches to the delicate neck inside'. In this sculpture Moore has created a similar effect by making a space between the figure's hair and her neck.",

The idea for the sculpture may have  originated in a series of studies of bathers  climbing out of a bath and drying their feet. As  in all his sculptures, Degas has focused not on  the figure's sexual identity but on her physical  action. 'These women of mine', he once said, 'are  honest, simple folk, unconcerned by any other  interests than those involved in their physical  condition'. While such comments are, to some  extent, typical of nineteenth-century attitudes,  recent scholars have debated the assumptions about  class and gender that Degas' works reveal.",

The  nude man crouching in long grass is seen rather  more clearly in the related oil painting 'Study of  Figure in a Landscape' 1952 (Phillips Collection,  Washington). The slashing brushstrokes suggest  that this immersion in nature is not without its  perils. These works followed Bacon's trips through  southern Africa in 1951 and 1952, but also drew  upon his enthusiasm for the photographs in  'Stalking Big Game with a Camera in Equatorial  Africa' by Marius Maxwell.",

The female figure is reminiscent of both classical sculpture and fashion mannequins, suggesting another contradiction within the work between high art and mass-produced everyday materials. Arman described sculptures like this, incorporating manufactured objects, as 'accumulations'.",

Sometimes he heard strange voices coming  from the room which he later discovered was simply  the maid talking through the wall to another  servant. Thus, the biblical narrative reminded him  of experiences in his own life. These also  included kneeling in prayer at church, and Cookham  villagers praying around the bed of a dying man, a  custom his mother had told him about. The youth on  the bed has Spencer's own features.",

    "description": "In his work of this period Derain explored the traditions of past art. The unusual size and monumental quality of this painting can be seen as reflecting his interest in seventeenth-century Baroque still lifes. Especially notable, however, are the stark contrasts of black and white and the inclusion of drawing instruments, symbols of the artist's craft. These speak of Derain's belief that the definition of lit surfaces was central to drawing, and that light was a physical manifestation of the spirit. He once wrote, 'One constructs a painting with light ... light defines the dimensions of adjacent surfaces and directs the rhythm of their relationship.'",

Motives for the paintings in general (as much as one dare to define them!) are architectural and philosophical in that the basically cubic container form has been connected with the cube/earth symbol in Plato's Timaeus.

Several members of the Schutz family held positions at the court of Hanover and it may be that this portrait also acts as an endorsement of the Hanoverian succession. Thus, the orange tree in the garden urn may symbolise William III and the House of Orange, while the white horse could represent the House of Hanover, whose heraldic device was a horse courant argent (a silver or white running horse).",

The young woman here, whose identity is unknown, appears to be in deep slumber. However, the awkward position of her arm suggests that her sleep might be feigned, and reminds us that the scene as a whole has been contrived by the artist. The woman's dress front appears casually undone, but its erotic appeal seems, again, quite calculated. The woman's face and hairstyle are modern, but her clothes have a timeless air, and her pose, as well as the dark tonality of the painting, have precedents in the art of the Old Masters.",

Kokoschka remarked that paintings had the habit of turning into political allegories if brought back to London unfinished, as in this case. This work with its transition from landscape to allegory proclaims Kokoschka's committed style of the early 1940s.",

Where lines of different direction were included they did not cross but simply abutted. In the early 1980s he began to make paintings with relief elements. He said, 'I liked the idea of looking at a painting that you could not look at just from the front but had to move around.' The triptych form of this work was deliberately chosen. Scully was very aware of the religious associations of this format. It also presented him with the possibility of 'putting something in the middle.' 'Paul' was painted about a year after the artist's son died, and was dedicated to his memory.",

The art critic David Sylvester wrote an article in December 1954 about recent painting, including that of Bratby, and he titled his article 'The Kitchen Sink'. Sylvester identified a shared interest among younger painters in commonplace domestic subjects. Bratby not only chose the kitchen as a subject, but also the bathroom. He made three paintings of lavatories and at least three of bathrooms. Bratby's three paintings of lavatories focus exclusively on the toilet and are very direct in both subject and colour.",

They were not, however, symbolic of anything else; they certainly were not surrogates for human beings or \u2018states of being.\u2019",

He was interested in philosophy and he saw the art he admired as expressing certain philosophical or fundamental truths. This painting by Michael Andrews demonstrates this principle. It portrays a tramp whom the artist sometimes saw when he occupied a communal studio in Digswell, Hertfordshire, in the late 1950s. Wilkie's attitude to such social outcasts - outsiders looking in on society - was compassionate and respectful. He observed that characters like Digswell Man, as Andrews called him, 'possess a true knowledge of human life... through their fundamental life'.",

On her return to London she was claimed by the new Surrealist movement as an important figure. Her work at that time included collage and found objects. Paintings since the 1960s have tended to be more traditional in material, but still full of her love of playing with illusion. This painting was originally titled 'The Dark Wood' and it shows two non-corporeal figures among dark leaves, surrounded by geometrical panels.",

    "description": "During the later part of his career Hornel made a speciality of pictures of young girls in a landscape, or beside a pool of water or the sea. This was a subject he had invented and he painted it repeatedly. As with 'Autumn', the oddity of all these pictures is that the children seem embedded in leaves or undergrowth. The colours and shapes overwhelm the subject. The lack of reality implies that everything, the children and the swans, is a symbol of some general idea, perhaps about innocence, although this is not specified. The paintings were popular, probably on account of their sentimentality. Hornel made a great deal of money and eventually bequeathed his large house in Kirkcudbright as a Library and Art Gallery for the town.",

That year he visited America, where he met many of the leading artists and recognised that his was an essentially European art.",

The overwhelming density of objects may reflect Guttuso\u2019s concern with the mass consumerism of post-war society. The multiple viewpoints and tilted planes show how Guttuso had assimilated the innovations of Cubism and reworked them into his own brand of realism. Guttuso gave this work as a gift to the Kahnweilers in 1962, after they visited him at his summer retreat near Lake Maggiore.",

This portrait was painted when Sickert was in his seventies; at this stage he often chose his  subjects from newspaper images, in this case  a photograph from the Radio Times of the actress on holiday in Venice. The painting's dry, grainy texture, and non-naturalistic, shadowless  colouring puts a distance between background, figure and viewer. This painting combines two  of Sickert's favourite themes: Venice and theatre.",

They were often projects for monumental public schemes, rarely achieved, in which sculpture and architecture came together. His proposal  that Monument for an Airport could be used  to advertise Imperial Airways, as either a desk display or an outdoor sculpture, was never realised. Model for 'Torsion', however, was eventually translated into a large fountain outside St Thomas' Hospital in London. Gabo's increasing concern, from the late 1930s, with the aesthetic aspect of his work at the expense of the industrial can be seen in Model for 'Construction in Space \"Crystal\"'.",

It represents a view looking across the river Oise towards M\u00e9ry and the Paris road. The view is taken from the top of a high and very steep embankment above a railway line. The old bridge of Auvers (since replaced by a modern structure) is on the right. The plumy forms in the bottom right-hand corner suggest the smoke of a passing train. It would appear that the trees along the riverbank are purely an imaginative addition by the artist. The work has been affected by fading and the colours are no longer as strong as they once were.",

Its avenue of chestnut trees provided the motif for a series of pictures by C\u00e9zanne, of which this is the earliest. Although difficult to date, it seems likely that it was painted after C\u00e9zanne's Impressionist phase. The construction of the picture, with its compressed space, heavy forms and slab-like diagonal foliage (made using a palette knife) is complex. It marks the first appearance of various elements that were to characterise many of his later, classically designed landscapes.",

Hofmann emigrated to the U.S.A from Germany in 1930 and in 1934 set up an art school in New York. He was a widely influential teacher. However, it was only after he closed his school in 1958 that his painting blossomed. Hofmann tended to work out the compositions of his paintings by pinning coloured paper shapes to his canvas. His work is a synthesis of Cubism, Fauvism and geometric abstraction. He regularly evoked nature but was keen to respect the inherent differences between pictorial experiences and those of the natural world. He wrote: 'In nature, light creates color: in the picture, color creates light.'",

This involved copying plaster casts of classical sculpture, and learning how to develop an idea from small clay sketches to full-scale plaster models, which could then be copied in bronze or stone by craftsmen. The inspiration for this work lies less with traditional classical models, however, than with archaic sculptures of an earlier period, and, perhaps, medieval statuary. The woman's flattened features, the way in which her arms are pulled into the body, and the theme of pregnancy were all anti-classical, and reflected Lipchitz's awareness of the new interest amongst avant-garde artists in previously disregarded types of past sculpture.",

In his use of strings in this and other sculptures of 1937-9 Moore was influenced by Naum Gabo's interest in articulating space. However, this practice is also an extension of Moore's interest in the intersection of space and solid as exemplified by pierced forms. Writing in 'Circle' the scientist J. D. Bernal stated that 'Negative curvature ... is characteristic of much modern work, as are subtle inflections and the use of nodal points.' This sculpture suggests, in an abstract way, a reclining female figure.",

These symbols were conceived by ancient civilizations and linked to the stellar constellations which are situated in a belt of the heavens traversed annually by the sun, hence the prominent position of the sun in a grouping which Procter set in planetary space.",

    "description": "The title of this picture refers to the annual commemoration on 19 April of the death of the great Conservative statesman Benjamin Disraeli (1804-81) who was Prime Minister in 1868 and from 1874-80. Primroses were said to be his favourite flower. The girl has been collecting primroses in her hat; others are arranged in a vase on the table, above which is a print of Disraeli. Bramley's picture is also an exercise in the colour harmonies of yellow, white and brown. A leading Newlyn painter, he has used the square brush and horizontal strokes for which the Newlyn artists were famous. Bramley was a founder member of the NEAC but resigned in 1890 after a vicious review of his work by Sickert. He was elected a Royal Academician in 1911.",

It was originally framed with a dark silver paper mount, which would have enhanced the mechanistic effect suggested by the harsh angular forms. As they lean precariously to one side, these forms also look like tottering architectural structures. Of all the Vorticists, Lewis was perhaps most consistently interested in the theme of the modern metropolis. The overall sensation of movement is achieved through the use of vertiginous, diagonal lines, which epitomise Lewis's Vorticist style. Despite the feeling of instability and agitation there is also a sense of order and strength of definition.",

He gave me the impression that something had very badly gone wrong in his life tho' he gave no inkling of what it was in a fairly long conversation.

The vigorous paint handling and intensity of facial expression make this painting a particularly moving example of Kokoschka's late work, akin in its mixture of animation and psychological urgency to the late works of Picasso. Begun when Kokoschka was eighty-five years old, this is the last of his many self-portraits.",

By freezing such moments in time, Starkey hopes to elevate them above the mundane and create lasting allegories  for modern life. Her carefully planned  and directed compositions fuse influences from painting and cinema. However, she withholds the possibility of any narrative conclusion, leaving viewers to construct their own fictions around her images.",

The movement itself cannot be perceived, but the disc appears to dissolve into a rippling light.

His enjoyment of modern life was reflected in his passion for the motor car and experiments with film-making.",

He had been the central figure of a group of painters at the nearby village of Pont-Aven. Then in 1890 he moved to Le Pouldu in search of an even simpler way of life. By this time Gauguin had abandoned his early Impressionist manner. Influenced by folk art and primitive art, he began to use flat areas of colour and a distorted perspective in his paintings. The landscape and life of the peasant community inspired some of the most rugged and radically simplified works of his career.",

Burgin uses this to indicate an aspect of bourgeois ideology; material success is presented as something to aspire to. Burgin deliberately opposes this view of the world by including a pr\u00e9cis of a Maoist parable about the socialist worker, Lei-Feng. In addition, Burgin includes a commentary in each panel where he analyses the underlying meaning of image and text.",

However, Smith's interest in mass media  and consumer culture is evident in the way that  the image is based on a cigar band. Also, as Smith  noted, 'the colour is rather tobacco and gold.'  One of Smith's concerns was to make connections  between 'high' art and popular culture. In this  respect 'Panatella' forms a link between abstract  painting and Pop art.",

After it was finished his dealer rejected it on the grounds that he had never seen hay of this colour.

This attention to the detail as well as enormity of nature reflects the critic John Ruskin\u2019s sentiment that a small stone was \u2018a mountain in miniature\u2019.

So like many artists before me I  turned to my own environment for subject matter  ... I wanted to make the ordinary miraculous. This  had nothing to do with social comment.

    "description": "Nicolete Gray was the daughter of Laurence Binyon,  poet and Keeper of Oriental Art at the British  Museum. She studied medieval history and in 1932  began the life long research into lettering which  led to her becoming a leading historian and  teacher of this subject and herself a lettering  artist. In 1936, she organised a contemporary art  exhibition 'Abstract and Concrete'. This included  work by Ben Nicholson, Hepworth and Moore, but  also introduced to the British public the work of  foreign abstract artists such as Calder, Gabo,  Giacometti, Kandinsky, Mir\u00f3 and Mondrian. Nicolete  Gray enjoyed a long and fruitful friendship with  David Jones. She wrote a monograph on his  inscriptions in 1981 and a book on his paintings  in 1989. Large painted inscriptions were an  important part of Jones's later work, beginning  around 1943. The Latin texts that Jones has chosen  here refer to Christmas. 'Exiit Edictum' comes  from the account of Christ's birth in St Luke's  Gospel, and the separate line of 'Iam Redit  Apollo' comes from Virgil's Fourth Eclogue, which  Christian writers believed prophesied Christ's  birth. Nicolete Gray stated that this inscription  is innovatory in two ways; firstly that Jones's  preferred coloured background and wax crayon  technique have been replaced by letters in  different colours on white paper; and secondly  Jones introduces here his practice of combining  fragments from different texts, so as to give  visual form to a complex of inter-related meaning.",

She adopts masculine gestures  and stances, and shows herself in unisex clothing like jeans and T-shirts. These images also raise questions about the  role and appearance of the modern  artist. In contrast to the clich\u00e9 of the  artist as an anguished male, Lucas  shows herself as an ordinary person  in emphatically ordinary surroundings.",

It is representative of an early phase of Rae's work in terms of its clarity of form and colour, unbalanced composition and disjointed motifs. Much of the canvas is left blank. As a result the marks themselves encourage more concentrated examination. Rae paints in a variety of manners, sometimes applying paint thickly and at others very thinly and flatly. Although she observes closely the styles of other artists she avoids parody by weaving them together in such a way as to transform them.",

He thereby anticipated by  many years the post-war development of what became  known as Art Informel and was widely influential  during this period. This painting was made by  scratching rhythmic and sweeping lines into the  top layer of a vinyl coating before it dried.  Hartung developed this particular technique in the  early 1960s.",

The drawing was made in London where Paolozzi had settled after a formative stay in Paris from 1947-9. There he had been drawn particularly to Surrealism with its rejection of conventional ideas of beauty, and its aim to make art directly from 'the depths of the mind'. In painting and drawing, this aim was often achieved by employing a free and improvisatory approach which would encourage a direct statement of inner feelings. The results, as here, were often akin to graffiti, or the art of the insane, or to 'primitive' or naive art. All of these were admired by artists such as Paolozzi for their freedom and directness of expression.",

This new screenprint is a play on Picasso's famously confrontational painting depicting prostitutes,  Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, which marked the  beginning of Cubism. Caulfield has reversed Picasso's image so that instead of viewing the women frontally, we peer at them from behind.  The reversal of this image is both a visual pun on the printing process, which reverses the original design, and a verbal pun on the French word  derri\u00e8re, which means rear end.",

Matisse's interest in African  art began around 1906, and is probably reflected in this painting. Based on a photograph rather than a model, it subverts the tradition of the academic studio nude. The austere colours are  a departure from the brightness of Matisse's earlier Fauvist period.",

There are four receding parallel rows of the same three letters, and in the first, the letter R is reversed, so that the first row may be read as RAW or WAR. In the second row 'War' may only be read backwards and similar reversals take place in the other two rows. This is one of Nauman's first lithographs, and relates to an earlier neon sign work, which flashes orange and red. Nauman uses the association of colour, sound and image to enrich and to broaden meaning. He has acknowledged that there is a political dimension to this work.",

    "description": "The figure of a clarinet player emerges from a series of block-like forms in this sculpture. Musical subject matter was typical of early works by the cubists Picasso and Braque, and the angular facets of this work suggest a relationship to the geometric shapes of cubist painting. The work also reflects the aesthetic ideals of purism, a movement which began after the First World War and sought to develop aspects of cubism, emphasising simplicity and harmony.",

Although Annette was one of his most frequent sitters, Giacometti found himself approaching her anew each time she posed. The surfaces of the sculptures were heavily worked and he commented that \u2018after three days of working she doesn\u2019t resemble herself any more\u2019. Giacometti\u2019s obsessive approach to his work is reflected in his observation that \u2018It\u2019s rather an unusual thing for a person to spend more of his time trying to copy a head than living life\u2019.",

    "description": "This is one of many watercolours Blake made  for his most important patron, Thomas Butts.  It was painted during Blake's stay in Felpham, Sussex when, in his own words, he put himself 'back as if I was a learner' and gave 'two years  to the intense study of... light & shade & colour.'  By comparing this work with the earlier temperas Blake painted for Butts, some of which are  shown in this room, we can get an idea of  the improvements Blake was aiming at in his  art: a renewed power of design (seen in the  symmetrical composition with its energetic,  flowing outlines), dark shadows rejected  in favour of more uniformity between light  and shade, and greater radiance in his colours.",

In the following two years, Warhol made thirty silkscreen paintings of her, always using the same publicity photograph from the 1953 film Niagara. This set of ten screenprints was produced in 1967, in an edition of 250. The repeated image serves as the basis for a series of startling colour transformations.",

In these photographs, she appears as a model covering herself up after posing for a nude centrefold.

Exhibited at the Royal Academy early in 1836, 'Juliet and her Nurse' became the subject of a vicious attack by the Reverend John Eagles in an article published in 'Blackwood's Magazine' later in the year. Eagles wrote that the picture was 'a strange jumble', but one of his chief complaints was that Turner should have chosen to set this scene from 'Romeo and Juliet' in Venice rather than Verona. No doubt Turner's decision to place Shakespeare's famous heroine in Venice was influenced by the romantic atmosphere of the city; in the foreground she is seen musing on her new-found love.",

Although Lewis had been close to them in the early 1920s, he heavily satirised them in The Apes of God 1930 as the epitome of cultural decline and vulgarity. The early sittings for this portrait were fraught with problems, such as Lewis\u2019s \u2018alarming\u2019 behaviour, and in the end Sitwell refused to sit any more. He shows her as a beautifully painted doll, deprived of the slender hands of which she was so proud.",

Such works question the relationship between art and the reality it depicts. This is one of a large series of works each consisting of nine panels and referring to various areas of culture.

Painted in pale-coloured household  gloss, they incorporate circles, squares and  rectangles to represent the windows and panels of  actual doors. They appear abstract, and yet they  accurately represent real doors. Hume used  housepaint to make the connection even more  literal. He also liked the reflective surface the  paint gave the works: '..it reflects the  environment which the works are shown in..  everything would be reflected within the painting,  including yourself...So they made you think about  light and about where the paintings begin and  end.'",

The subtle use of texture and treatment of the surface adds a three-dimensional aspect to the painting. The forms are deliberately asymmetrical and hand-drawn, exemplifying the subtle subversion of European geometric abstraction in Brazilian art through the introduction of organic or destabilising elements. Schendel contributed to the development of Concrete and Neo-concrete art in Brazil during the 1960s, though she remained detached from those groups and developed a distinct and unique body of work.",

However, it is more likely to show George III\u2019s horse, Adonis. Although he specialised in painting animals, Ward consistently used allegory in his paintings, so this work may be intended to show the power of the monarchy (the horse) being threatened by the government (the serpent) as it prepared to widen the franchise by passing the Great Reform Bill in 1832.",

But Lewis set aside their differences to produce this tribute to his friend. It is one of a series of portraits Lewis began in 1938, which also included T.S. Eliot and Stephen Spender. The composition is dominated by the diagonal lines of Pound's reclining body and the newspapers, which are offset by the strong verticals on the left.",

Kossoff was a student of David Bomberg (whose work is also on show here). Bomberg maintained that there could be no good painting without drawing. In common with Bomberg, drawing is a crucial activity for Kossoff and he draws constantly from the landscape and the figure. Here, the heavily worked surface has been repeatedly erased and re-drawn. This records the artist's many previous attempts to give form to a final definitive image, which is usually executed in one session. The portrait is thus spontaneous, but also founded on accumulated experience of the subject.",

The objects may also be interpreted as having symbolic associations, so that the guitar may allude to artistic harmony and the apples, branch and glass may celebrate the abundance of nature.",

In the 1960s he returned to figurative painting and reintroduced the hooded Klansmen to his work. Guston meant his paintings to be interpreted in the light of the political violence of the decade, but he also saw the Klan paintings as ironic self-portraits: 'The idea of evil fascinated me\u00bfI almost tried to imagine that I was living with the Klan. What would it be like to be evil? To plan, to plot.'",

John then painted out a figure at the centre, and suggested alterations to compensate. Hugh Lane died in 1915, and his paintings were never finished.Lyric Fantasy was not displayed, nor given its title, until 1940.

In 1990 she re-examined documentary practice and the power dynamics involved in her representation of the women involved.

He argued that surrealism and abstraction were not incompatible, and wrote of the importance of the \u2018nonlogical, instinctive, subconscious part of the mind\u2019 in his artistic process.",

In 1950 she  discovered the small fishing village of Catterline  on the east coast of Scotland, and was captivated  by the place. She rented cottages there from 1950  to 1961, when Catterline became her permanent  home. Fishermen caught crabs and lobster in summer  and cod and haddock in winter. There was also a  salmon season from February to August when these  fish were caught in bag nets. The nets were  stretched out to dry on the grass above the high  water line of the Catterline shore and Eardley  painted them on the spot.",

Because his hands were too small to work the clay in the way he wanted, he wore two oversize pairs of workman's gloves, thereby ending up with fingers five or six inches long. The increase in size of his hands allowed him to work more broadly than he would have otherwise been able. De Kooning's interest in the expressiveness of the material falls within the tradition of sculpture beginning with Rodin and taken up by Giacometti.",

Both types of object evoke interference with nature.

    "description": "Coldstream wanted to develop an objective manner of painting, transcribing onto canvas precisely what he saw before him. This supposed objectivity was most clearly shown by his technique of measuring the distances between different points on the body and marking them on the canvas with red paint.  But these marks may also function as active parts of the image. For example, the clusters around the model\u2019s nipples seem to inject an erotic undertone.Coldstream\u2019s desire for precision and objectivity meant that he rarely decided a painting was finished, but simply stopped when he reached a deadline.",

They are very active, they're very  fantasy-like, and they are very simple \u00c4 even  brutal \u00c4 in the way that fairy tales are...I had  the feeling that with a little bit of mental  jockeying their forms could represent things. It  wasn't hard to imagine them being a cat or a  person'. The title, from a tale of the same name,  means 'Jump into my Sack'.",

Its narrower bands of colour make it less target-like, and they emphasise the effect of rotation which Noland was seeking. This effect is enhanced further by the introduction of irregular staining at the edge of the outer ring. Previously, Abstract Expressionist painters such as de Kooning and Rothko had been seeking to express intensity of feeling in their paintings. In creating an illusion of rotation, 'Drought' demonstrates that the intensity sought by Noland was visual rather than emotive.",

    "description": "The dynamism of Bacon's studies of the body is  evident in 'Turning Figure'. Preliminary pencil  sketching was obliterated by energetic pink and  green paint, with the precariousness of the body  anchored by the stable green frame. In general  terms, the sketch relates to a number of 1962 oil  paintings (from which the title has been  borrowed). The complications of the poses were  associated by John Russell with Bacon's  observation that 'Painting makes me more aware of  behaviour'.Bacon gave this work to the poet Stephen Spender,  who wrote a number of articles on him around 1961.  It was accompanied by 'Figure in a Landscape' and  the pair of 'Reclining Figures', also in this  display.",

The  splits in the wood occurred while the work was in  progress, and so the artist abandoned it  unfinished. Nonetheless, the sculpture embodies a  strong empathy with the Cornish landscape which  inspired it, and with the material used: 'I  believe that the understanding of the material and  the meaning of the form being carved must be in  perfect equilibrium.' There is another, smaller  version, 'Tides II', which was executed in the  same year. This sculpture was presented to the  Tate Gallery by Ben Nicholson in the year of  Hepworth's death.",

    "description": "Hilton titled many of his paintings simply by the  date of their completion so as to emphasise his  desire that the work be seen for itself, and not  in any representational way. However, by the 1960s  he had developed a new kind of figurative  language. In his compositions of these years  abstract shapes and looping lines often suggest  the presence of a figure or landscape, or both.  These bold forms are obsessional, recurring  constantly in his paintings. Works of this  period, such as 'September 1961', are also less  densely painted and more atmospheric than earlier  works. This could well be the result of his  growing sensitivity to his light-filled, airy  surroundings.",

Previously she had applied paint in dabs which created a mottled effect. This work is painted with rather freer brush strokes. The elongated vertical format is characteristic of von Motesiczky\u2019s canvases of the period.",

He returned to the theme in 1957, completing 31 paintings including this work and 'In the Cave' (also shown in this room). In the 1860s Eliza Fraser and her husband were shipwrecked on an island off the coast of Queensland. After her husband was murdered by aborigines, Mrs Fraser lived among them. They fed her but stripped her. She was rescued by an escaped convict, David Bracefell, who became her lover and whom Mrs Fraser eventually betrayed. This painting depicts Mrs Fraser in the tropical rain forest which she inhabited for months with Bracefell during their return to civilisation.",

It took, and from that day to this I have had as much to do as my hands could execute.' In all his depictions the castle is seen at dawn, its dark form given emphasis by the rising sun beyond, an effect which must have been one of Turner's chief joys in repeating the subject so often. This watercolour was executed in the early 1820s for a group of views of the Rivers of England by which time he had already included a similar view in his Liber Studiorum.",

Bourgeois made her first prints in the 1940s and, after a gap of about forty years, returned to printmaking in 1990. Frequently child-like in style, these works portray the events and fantasies of her childhood and adolescence. The scenes include the trauma of birth, the pubescent discovery of the body, the moulding of a daughter by her mother, and the stifling of a daughter by her father.",

The depth of the blocks varies, allowing some colours to remain visible as either surfaces or as the thickness of the relief. Apart from perspex Martin has used both the smooth and textured faces of hardboard to give variety to the surfaces.

The open landscape is an unusual feature in the paintings Dadd made after his imprisonment and it is likely to have been based on views from the terrace at Broadmoor asylum. The figures of the musicians were probably drawn from inmates, while the instruments were observed from those owned by Dadd who was a passionate musician. The theme may derive from the Idylls of Theocritus, the Ancient Greek pastoral poet whose name appears on the broken frieze in the foreground.",

The pastels depicted women in dog-like positions, scavenging for food, baying at the moon, sleeping and grooming. Rego's daughter posed for this work wearing a 1950's raw silk wedding dress loaned by a friend. An early idea for 'Bride' had the model sitting on all fours, but Rego turned the figure so that she is 'belly-up in an attitude of surrender and ready to have her tummy tickled'. Rego has also noted that 'her hands and feet are uncovered, it was so vital that her extremities were exposed as they are in all animals'.",

His early abstract paintings were composed of shimmering combinations of short vertical and horizontal brushstrokes in pinks, reds and blues. Discussing The Return, Guston said that he saw the forms in the picture as being like figures who had been away for some time and who were now returning - jostling each other a little as they came.",

He is known to have spent days at a time in the brothels, where he was accepted by the prostitutes as a friend and confidant. During these periods he was able to make numerous studies of the women in casual, everyday poses, as they waited for their clients. This painting seems to be a study for part of a larger painting known as 'In the Salon', in the large collection of works by this artist at the Mus\u00e9e d'Albi in France.",

His proposal  that Monument for an Airport could be used  to advertise Imperial Airways, as either a desk display or an outdoor sculpture, was never realised. Model for 'Torsion', however, was eventually translated into a large fountain outside St Thomas' Hospital in London. Gabo's increasing concern, from the late 1930s, with the aesthetic aspect of his work at the expense of the industrial can be seen in Model for 'Construction in Space \"Crystal\"'.",

Pevsner made a full scale sculpture in bronze from this model in 1955-6. It belongs to the French National Museum of Modern Art in Paris.

Notorious for his inclusion of even more ephemeral materials, Roth also included chocolate and butter in this composition.",

It seemed to me wonderful that a strong emotion, such as was Palmer's, could change and transform the appearance of things.'

To create the network of lines, the artist first marked a drawing with points, moving clockwise round a rectangle. Lines were then generated by taking numbers, two at a time, at random out of a bag. Martin chose eight pairs of numbers for this work. He then instigated the Change of the title by turning the drawing through 90 degrees and repeating the process. This process was repeated twice more. The drawing was then transferred to canvas.",

Milroy's London paintings focus on the clinical facades of office buildings in Holborn, Euston, Old Street and Finsbury Square. Depicted in flat unmodulated colour the usually teeming streets and busy offices are unnaturally denuded of human life.

It  was Fry who gave intellectual focus to the  Bloomsbury Group of artists and writers. He had  trained as a painter in France and Italy, and with  Sickert in London, but became best known as a  highly influential writer, critic and lecturer.  Fry organised two exhibitions of  Post-Impressionist art in 1910 and 1912,  showing types of European pictures then little  known in Britain.",

Epstein described this  figure as expressing ' a humility so profound  as to shame the beholder who comes to my sculpture expecting rhetoric or splendour  of gesture'. When he first exhibited it he called  it 'A Study' so as to diguise its content.",

Their marriage is referred to through the priestly figure officiating at an altar on the urn behind them, and by the Latin inscription on the pedestal by the poet Virgil. Here, Gallus, a pilgrim in Arcadia, states how he would willingly give up hunting with his hounds in order to be with his beloved shepherdess. Likewise, Cowper turns away from his favourite dog towards his new wife.The child is probably the couple\u2019s eldest daughter, Theodora, who was added to the picture at a later date.",

In 1940 he trained as an artillery man and was commissioned in camouflage before becoming a war artist in 1943. Many of his portraits of high-ranking officers and advisers are now in the Imperial War Museum. His portraits were often swiftly executed but sensitively observed. Influenced by artists such as Edouard Manet and Diego Velazquez, Moynihan used a rich sensuous brushstroke to convey a sense of this young service woman's physicality. During the war women were urged to look their best at all times to boost morale. Lipstick became known as the 'red badge of courage'.",

Model for 'Torsion', however, was eventually translated into a large fountain outside St Thomas' Hospital in London.

Venus Forge is an arrangement of metal tiles that can be walked on by the viewer, emphasising the relationship between sculpture and floor. Andre also draws attention to his materials, contrasting highly polished copper with the dark surface of steel. The number of tiles is potentially endless.  In theory, Venus Forge could stretch forever.",

He may even have considered using this Netley composition for that work: the figure at the left contemplating a tombstone (a detail not in the original pencil drawing) is a stock motif in all illustrations of the 'Elegy'. At the same time this melancholy image, based on a honeymoon drawing, would have carried a personal meaning for Constable in his widowhood.",

Here, Reynolds has  dignified the sitter, posing him in the manner  usually preserved for an aristocratic white man.  The original version was probably painted in the  1770s, a period at which the slave trade was still  in operation in America and Europe's colonies.",

    "description": "This lively pair of portraits was commissioned by John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute. It was probably Bute who introduced Zoffany to the King and Queen, commencing a highly successful period of royal patronage for the artist.In the portrait on the right, Bute\u2019s three younger sons have abandoned their game of archery to go bird-nesting. In the companion picture his three daughters play with pet squirrels. The setting for both portraits is Bute\u2019s country estate, Luton Park, Bedfordshire, which he acquired in 1763. These portraits display both Bute\u2019s progeny and his position as an important landowner.",

    "description": "This picture shows the twelve year old Jesus being carried back to Nazareth. This happened after Joseph and Mary had returned to Jerusalem and found Jesus with the elders in the Temple. The artist used chapter 2 of the Gospel according to St Luke as his source. Like other works by Dobson, this picture reflects the time he spent with the German Nazarene artists in Germany and Italy during the 1840s and 1850s. The Nazarene style was characterized by a fairly vigorous handling of gesture and design. This was to influence the Pre- Raphaelites. Dobson avoided the censure which greeted these artists because his characterization was diluted, as here, by a degree of sentimentalization.",

The School closed in 1939 with the onset of war, but Pasmore continued to paint in the manner of its teachings during the 1940s. He produced a series of small and tender portrait and nude studies of his wife, Wendy, whom he married in June 1940. This is one of them and it presents Wendy Pasmore in a quiet and intimate manner, with the parted curtains adding to the private nature of the scene.",

Travelling by truck, train, aeroplane and boat, he journeyed inland across New South Wales to Adelaide. He then went north across the central desert to Darwin, returning via the Western coast to Sydney. The view of inland Australia seen from the air made the greatest impression on Nolan. He was profoundly affected by the vast scale, desolation and silence of the desert - the second largest in the world. Like his many other paintings of this subject, this work is what Nolan called a 'composite impression'. It combines documentary observation with visionary imagination, faithfully evoking a landscape whose immensity seems strangely unreal.",

The work depicts a picnic at the moment when, as day draws to a close, the group of friends realise that they must return home. The picture is set in the Oxfordshire countryside which Allen loved and where he lived. But in the distance is the image of the cooling towers of the power station at Didcot, which Allen disliked. The figures are thus caught between an imaginative, pastoral idyll and the problems of the modern industrial world. The title and some of the work's imagery were inspired by Watteau but the painting was intended more as a tribute to Titian.",

Charleston is situated near to Lewes, Sussex and at the foot of the South Downs. Both Grant and Bell had their own studios in the farmhouse and views of its exterior and interior were the subject of many of their paintings. They also lavished their decorative talents upon the walls, doors, furniture, textiles and ceramics within the farmhouse, all of which is still intact. The farmhouse and garden are open to the public.",

    "description": "From the mid-1920s Moore had advocated the abolition of the 'Greek ideal' in sculpture in favour of non-European sources, which he felt had much greater vitality. This work reveals his fascination with the Mesopotamian sculptures in the British Museum, especially solemn standing figures with clasped hands. He reviewed a book on Mesopotamian art for 'The Listener' in June 1935. Around 1931-2 Moore also turned his attention to the study of natural forms, such as shells, bones and pebbles. He then brought together his studies in natural forms with his admiration for non-European 'primitive' sculpture and began to introduce a rhythmic and non-naturalistic approach to the depiction of the human figure.",

The conflict in Spain was the setting for Lewis's novel 'The Revenge for Love', which was published in 1937. However, Lewis denied any connection between this picture and the book. In 1950 Lewis wrote: 'In the Surrender of Barcelona I set out to paint a Fourteenth Century scene as I should do it could I be transported there, without too great change in the time adjustment involved.' The frieze of soldiers in the foreground can be seen as alluding to Velasquez's painting 'Surrender of Breda' 1635.",

The landscape is taken from studies made around the Umbrian town of Piediluco; the imagery was partly inspired by general ideas about Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, but also more particularly by Monnington's love of Italy and delight in his marriage in 1924 to Winifred Knights, a fellow painter at the British School. The Adam and Eve-like figures are based on Monnington and Knights. Two paintings by Knights are also on display in this gallery.",

    "description": "Following 'The Burial of Count Orgaz' 1958 (also in this room), in 1959-60 Latham made four book reliefs. These comprise the 'Observer' series of which this is the final work. Like the other three reliefs, 'Observer IV' has a triangular composition. The three points forming this structure represent three kinds of 'observing persons' which Latham connects with the three brothers in Dostoevsky's novel 'The Brothers Karamazov'. He interprets the brothers as representing three states of existence and self-awareness. The three points in the work thus correspond with the brothers and, in turn, with the states that the brothers represent. The mass of material on the right relates to Mitya who signifies spontaneous experience and instinct. Mitya is connected by a tube to Ivan at the top of the canvas who signifies an intellectual state capable of observing the Mitya state. The small, wedge shape at bottom left is linked with Aloysha - independent of Mitya and Ivan and signifying a higher reflective level capable of observing the other two. Dostoevsky's novel informed Latham's view of the artist as an 'incidental person' who, like Aloysha, is an independent observer, reflecting and reaching insights through intuition. Latham has commented that the 'Observer' series 'isn't intended as allegory but as geometry (evenometry) of the three basic kinds of person.'",

After this has hardened, the resulting mould is taken apart in sections, and from this a cast in fibreclass is made. The advantage of this process is that an exact facsimile of the subject's features is obtained. Despite their precision, Davies has observed that life casts communicate little about the subject's character. Also, this realistic cast incorporates the strange addition of cones of chicken wire placed over the face. Consequently, this head does not characterise an individual, but represents human personality in general.",

She has written that her interest then centred on the relationship between a form and its surrounding space as well as its integral size, texture and weight.

They began to question classical standards of beauty by looking afresh at the art of non-European cultures. Eric Gill's interest in the art of non-European cultures developed before the 1920s, largely through the influence of the philosopher and theologian Ananda Coomaraswamy. In 1908 Coomaraswamy's lecture on Indian Art made a deep impression on Gill. In this sculpture Gill explores the relationship between the sacred and the profane, drawing in particular on traditional Indian sculpture.",

    "description": "This painting's six principal images are an aeroplane, a paw mark, a paddle, a meal table, an explosion and a window. From corner to corner Cohen painted an aeroplane in one set of colours which, while wet, he scraped in numerous directions. He painted the rest of the canvas in a contrasting set of scraped colours. Within the aeroplane's boundaries he then painted an image using the second set of colours, and repeated it (a different size, sometimes inverted, dismembered or as if projected) in the non-aeroplane space, but in the aeroplane colours. This process continued until all spaces were full. Colours were intended to clash as much as possible. The orientation of each image was determined by its having to rest on a scraped line. Here, as in many of Cohen's works, an unpredictable scatter of forms grows as the painting develops. Cohen sees this progression as akin to that of a meal. As a Jew, his experience of the Passover meal gave him a heightened sense, from an early age, that shared meals can have complex meanings. As he has observed, one Passover meal, the Last Supper, was eaten on 'the eve of Chaos'. Here, as in Sienese painting, smaller 'predella' panels amplify a picture's principal image. Cohen was also concerned with the notion of the traces left by the passage of anything across space, land or time. The marks here are literally traces of the delicate stencils, cut by him, through which they were painted. Paddles have no top or bottom; their irregular arrangement here accords with Cohen's decision that the painting may be hung any way up.",

The sky is sufficiently developed to show that the weather is fine, and the warm clouds suggest afternoon.  The bank and the water are suggested only by the cows\u2019 hooves in the water, and their reflections, yet give the viewer a clear impression of where the still water must be. The trees balance the distribution of the buildings.

During the early 1940s he renounced his early abstract style and turned instead to the Australian themes which are central to his subsequent work. His principal subjects are the Australian landscape, and stories deriving from Australian history. A main source of inspiration was the legend of the nineteenth century Australian outlaw and folk hero Ned Kelly. Kelly was the leader of a gang of bank robbers whose daring exploits achieved notoriety. The metal body armour worn by the gang captured popular imagination. This painting relates to the Siege of Glenrowan in 1880, a gunbattle between the gang and police in which Kelly was finally captured.",

He developed this technique in works such as VAV. One of his so-called 'veil' paintings, it was made by pouring very liquid paint down its surface. In applying paint in this way Louis was reacting against Abstract Expressionist painters such as de Kooning and Kline. They had emphasised gestural brushwork as a means of personal expression. By pouring paint, Louis sought to exclude expression because the artist no longer directly controlled the marks which resulted. Also, the stained canvas no longer 'bore' a representative image. Instead it became an object in itself.",

    "description": "The French-Canadian painter Riopelle was one of  the artists included in the 1951 exhibition in  Paris, 'V\u00e9h\u00e9mences Confront\u00e9es' (Opposing Forces).  He had been living in Paris since 1947, and  brought to his work both a North American  background and a distinctly European sensibility.  In the early 1950s Riopelle had experimented with  dripping and splashing paint, creating densely  covered canvases in vivid colours. He went on to  develop a distinctive technique using a palette  knife to apply the paint in quick, sharp strokes  all over the canvas. This resulted in a thickly  worked surface, or 'impasto'. This painting was  executed in this way. The marks are suggestive of  the painter's action in applying the paint.",

    "description": "Scott was primarily a painter of marine and river  views, especially of the Thames. The latter were  inspired by those of Canaletto who, like Scott,  was interested in the construction of old  Westminster Bridge. Construction began in 1739,  but Scott's paintings of it were probably done in  1750 just before it was opened to traffic. This  particular oil is one of five versions. Its small  size suggests that it is possibly the first Scott  painted, worked up from pencil studies made on the  spot, to test ideas he had for his much larger and  monumental work. Like Canaletto, Scott has  included a touch of humour: on top of the  balustrade a construction worker is taking a  well-earned break.",

In the background, through the gate, 'superstitious' locals are kneeling before the Cross, beneath a tavern sign of a dove, symbol of the Holy Ghost, in Hogarth's mockery of the Eucharist. More earthly nourishment, however, comes in the form of the unattainable sirloin of British beef. Hogarth's  contempt for the French should be set against his enormous debt to French art and design, evident  in much of his work.",

This abstraction nevertheless remained inspired by the landscape and wildlife about her.

This example is from Objective Abstraction's middle phase, when definite marks and longer strokes had given way to denser textures. In his words: 'the gradual thickening of the paint was ... a kind of build-up as a result of correction and suggestion'. He was 'continually aware of the lung movement of paint, its ability to breathe and move upon the surface of the canvas'.",

Rather than following Caro\u2019s example of a compositionally driven practice, Araeen decided that symmetrical configuration should form the basis of a new kind of sculpture. Formally Rang Baranga resembles the structures of Sol Lewitt\u2019s open minimalist sculptures, but unlike the American artist\u2019s, Araeen\u2019s forms incorporate diagonal and orthogonal elements which refer in part to Islamic art but more importantly point to his training and practice as an engineer.",

Before joining the group, C\u00e9sar had already begun  making sculptures from car bodies compressed into  dense packages. In 1968 he visited London to give  a sculpture-making demonstration, sponsored by the  Friends of the Tate Gallery. While here, he  visited a scrap metal merchant and asked that a  number of standard compressions of wheel hubs be  prepared for his inspection. This work was created  by his selecting three from the forty or fifty  made, and arranging them into the specific  configurations seen here.",

The pressures of conformity ('my swaddling bands') will release this spirit in 'struggling' and 'striving against'. The act of sulking on his mother's breast suggests only a brief respite before the 'fiend' (properly, the child's true individuality) finally asserts itself in adulthood.",

After the war he returned to the theme of landscape, firstly on painting expeditions to North Devon and Cornwall in 1946 and 1947 respectively, and then in Cyprus in the summer of 1948. In Cyprus Bomberg was inspired by the bright Mediterranean light and produced a series of 'fiery' landscapes. These Cyprus paintings are composed of loose, fluid brushstrokes which are almost abstract in their handling. Paradoxically they serve to emphasise the sense of the forms of the topography with a great intensity.",

These had an intrinsic quality of immediacy or spontaneity and allowed him to imagine the finished product in the round. In order to translate the scale of the work more effectively, he often made larger working models as an intermediate stage between the maquette and the finished sculpture. Moore\u2019s maquettes were typically cast in bronze in editions of up to ten. The sculptor strove for monumentality in his work and tried to imbue the same quality in the small maquettes. He also took a great deal of care with their finish. Some were more polished than others, some darker, some greener. Moore did all the patination himself, treating the bronze with different acids to achieve different effects then working on it by hand, rubbing and wearing it down.",

While working in his studio Motherwell was struck by the shapes resulting from the back of a small painting leaning against the painted surface of a larger one. By outlining the smaller painting in charcoal he was able to suggest an opening at the bottom of the canvas. He inverted subsequent compositions so that a painted rectangle appeared at the top. For Motherwell, 'abstract art is a form of mysticism'. Thus his colours are associated with particular emotions and the rectangular form suggests a gateway or enclosure within a metaphysical space.",

Kandinsky exhibited in London during the years 1909-13. His abstract style must have appealed to avant-garde artists such as Lewis.",

Priam, King of Troy, prostrates himself before Achilles to plead for the body of Hector, which Achilles has desecrated in furious revenge for the death of his friend Patroclus; Achilles begins to yield to compassion.

Some favourite domestic objects appeared several times, such as a dark coffee pot, small painted boxes, patterned cloths and richly coloured oriental rugs bought on her travels. These are laid out in compositions full of spatial ambiguity. Blackadder chose the objects for their colour and shape but equally they have a special personal meaning for her. She is fascinated by exotic plants and fruits and especially pomegranates 'which as well as being visually exciting with their jewel-like seeds always seemed to me to be particularly poetic with mythic connections.'This painting was chosen by Maureen Duffy.",

The subject symbolised for him a primeval or mythical harmony between man and nature. After the Second World War, however, his figures on horses often expressed anguish. This related to Marini's experience of seeing Italian peasants on frightened horses fleeing bombardment during the War. The artist wrote that this sculpture was 'the result of a sad period which Italy passed through during the War', and described it as 'enclosed in geometrical lines', and 'very precise in its tragic and human significance'.",

He painted  St Mark's basilica several times under different  conditions, possibly inspired by Monet's paintings  of Rouen Cathedral, which he had seen in Paris.  However, unlike Monet, he was not concerned with  fleeting effects of light. Instead, he  concentrated on the structure and mosaics, using  the light to accentuate the sparkling gold  pinnacles and to emphasise the spirituality of the  basilica. This is Sickert's largest and most  elaborate depiction of the front elevation. The  title includes the Latin motto of the city: 'Peace  be unto to you, Mark, my Evangelist'. The picture  was first exhibited at the New English Art Club in  1897.",

But in the 1930s Hepworth looked more towards European abstract and Surrealist models. 'Seated Figure' still retains vestiges of primitivism, but displays a growing interest in abstract organic forms. Hepworth, like Moore was concerned to be truthful to her materials: The sculpture is suggestive of a tree trunk from which the form is released.",

    "description": "This was made shortly after Pasmore's first abstract collage, during a transitional phase in his career. The structures and patterns, shapes and colours of his landscape - inspired paintings had evolved into a formal vocabulary, and Pasmore began to work in a more abstract manner. While he was also making paintings based on square or spiral forms, a major line of investigation during this time was collage in the Cubist manner, which he developed between 1949-53. Here he used scraps of coloured paper and newsprint to give a new reality, that is an anti-illusionistic content, to his compositions.",

Near the centre, he applied emerald green and bright red vermilion in a resin-rich paint that cracked as it dried, to give a strong colour contrast. Emerald green was the first intensely green pigment Turner could obtain, and had not long been available. Previous generations and many of his own circle mixed greens from blue and yellow, to give less intense and more harmonious shades. \n\nThe dazzling light was created by using a palette knife, a brush, the brush-end, scratches from Turner\u2019s thumb-nail (kept long for this purpose), and light blue paint to contrast with the yellow.  This contrast is now muted by yellowed varnish, which suppresses blue tones.",

By minimising his physical presence in the process of fabrication, LeWitt emphasises the importance of the concept behind the work. 'The idea becomes a machine that makes the art', he has said.",

The paradoxical titles of both paintings are taken from the names of oil paints, implying that the division between black and white is not as clear as the proponents of apartheid believed. The young black woman in Ivory Black wears a diaphanous white garment that seems to simultaneously veil and reveal her body. With her arms held tightly to her sides, she is an ambiguous figure, both guarded and exposed, empowered and captive.",

The background of the picture depicts a section of the Breton coastal landscape at Camaret-sur-Mer where the artist had spent some time in 1911.

Milles was a Swedish-born sculptor who was best known in his day for public sculpture and large monuments. His traditional subject matter and classical style seem barely touched by the radical developments in modern sculpture which were happening around him. It may be for this reason that he was considered a suitable, if conservative, choice for an exhibition at the Tate Gallery in 1927. Europa and the Bull was on display in this exhibition and was bought by the gallery soon afterwards (see archive records in display case).",

Something of his  air of personal authority can perhaps be sensed in  this portrait. Towards the end of his life  Pissarro began to enjoy financial security, and,  indeed, received official recognition in 1903, the  year in which he executed this painting, when two  of his works were bought by the Louvre.",

He is shown here in  'Van Dyck' costume, a fancy dress version of  Cavalier attire which it was then fashionable for  portrait sitters to wear. It is the same costume,  in fact, that was worn by Jonathan Buttall in  Gainsborough's famous full-length portrait known  as the 'Blue Boy' (Huntington Art Gallery, San  Marino, California). It is thought that the artist  painted this portrait of Richard Gardiner 'as a  trial of colour' before attempting the 'Blue Boy'.",

Caprice, in which a woman is invited through a doorway by a dwarf, and on the back, Woman with a White Mouse. Both are ambiguous scenes that appear to represent carnival. Caprice derives from the drawing Comedy Ballet of Marionettes I which appeared in the \u2018Yellow Book\u2019 in 1894. Like Beardsley\u2019s drawings, Caprice simplifies shape and colour to strengthen the effect.",

    "description": "Davies's 'William Jeffrey with Device', also in this display, was cast from life. However, 'Dogman' was originally modelled by the artist in clay. A plaster mould was then made, and from this the head was cast in fibreglass and painted. Both sculptures incorporate what Davies calls a 'device'. Here, this takes the form of a dog-like muzzle which was modelled onto the features of the head. Glass eyes complete the illusion of reality, despite this bizarre appendage. The viewer is thus presented with a paradox: a head which appears both naturalistic and simultaneously fantastic. Davies exploits this disturbing ambiguity to amplify the physical presence of this 'portrait'.",

Lanyon's widow recalls that he was always putting together and taking apart works of this kind. Though still constructed, Lanyon's sculpture of the 1950s was more painterly in character. He described these later works as 'experiments in space to establish the illusion and the content of space in painting'.",

He painted and sketched many river views of London from 1925 to the early 1970s, most frequently looking up or downstream from buildings near Waterloo Bridge. This view looks down river toward St Paul's Cathedral. Painted during a hot October, the artist's vantage point was the roof of the Shell-Mex building on the Strand. The picture was painted entirely on the spot without preliminary studies of any kind.",

Until the mid-1960s Bell concentrated on making works using a box format. In 1968 he said that what interested him most about his later boxes all seemed to happen in certain sections of the unit. By then he felt that this format had become an inhibiting factor which he had to destroy or pass beyond. He began to experiment with works of an environmental character and to create a space which people could walk around and into, and at the same time see through. However, in the interests of safety visitors must keep behind the barriers.",

The Change, painted early in 1957, is constructed from randomly applied dabs of paint and a loose grid of black lines.

Here a group of gentlefolk enjoy a game of cards. Their status as patrons of the arts is suggested by the presence of an artist, his assistant carrying a folder of sketches, and by an allegory of 'Painting and Sculpture' hanging on the wall. In the left corner turned from the group, a small black page fetches a glass of wine from a wine cooler. In many conversation pieces black servants appear as silent shadowy figures, alienated from the life of the household, often depicted like pets or other possessions.",

In the following four views,  however, it is the pictorial potential of natural  landscape features which is Turner's primary  concern. Forsaking topographical accuracy, these  studies are compelling experiments in idealised  landscape painting. They embody Turner's progress  beyond the conventions of tightly controlled  watercolour painting, and transcend Wilson's  influence in the production of powerful  atmospheric effects.",

As a lawyer, his work on high-profile libel cases drew him into the affairs of state. In 1965 he was appointed chairman of  the Arts Council and made a life peer. This portrait was painted over at least two series of sittings,  at Sutherland's house in the South of France.  At this late stage in his career, Sutherland was applying paint with great fluency, but extremely thinly, over his characteristic grid of pencil lines.",

However, the dream-like atmosphere of his works, together with his erotic preoccupation with an ideal female figure, led to him being recognised as one of the leaders of Belgian Surrealism. The subject of this painting is the classical myth of the sexual encounter of Jupiter, disguised as a swan, and Leda. The story was part of the repertoire of traditional art and Delvaux has alluded to the works of past masters such as Raphael and Ingres in some details of the composition. However, the setting is an incongruously modern, urban landscape, which in its emptiness suggests strangeness and alienation.",

It contrasts with the densely worked surfaces of her paintings during the 1970s. Ayres has explained that she wanted to achieve a sense of the sublime through the scale of markings. It also differs from other paintings of the early 1980s in having a yellow ochre ground rather than a white ground. The reason for this was that she was snowed in for several days and was unable to purchase any white lead. As usual, the title was given after the painting was completed. Ayres's titles do not describe the subject of the paintings. Rather the titles have a 'resonance' which relates to the character of each work.",

    "description": "In his paintings of the early 1920s, Jack Yeats surveyed the character and activities of the ordinary people of Western Ireland. He used a bold drawing in outline that is almost caricature, which he then painted directly with strong colours. Here a man stares over the parapet of the bridge at Sligo into the muddy water of the river. His deportment and expression suggest a particular type of local character. Yeats grew up near Sligo, and knew the people well. In about 1925 Yeats took up a quite different manner of painting, with lighter colours, particularly blues, and looser shapes, and with imaginary subjects from Irish history.Jack Yeats was the younger brother of the poet W.B. Yeats.",

In the mid-1960s Scott simplified and clarified his paintings, using bolder shapes and eliminating textural contrasts. Paint was evenly and thinly applied, as here.",

Weight wanted to execute a comic painting and became fascinated with making the lion appear to spring out of the cage. The title of the painting was suggested by a musical friend of the artist after it had been completed. Allegro means 'merry' or 'lively', while strepitoso means 'noisily'. The theme of attack and escape is one that runs throughout Weight's work.",

The just detectable squaring-up marks and the precisely located bodily contours recall the fidelity to observation of the Euston Road School artists of whom Pasmore was a leading member. At the same time the freedom of touch in the bedclothes looks back to Pasmore's sensuous paintings in the mid-1930s. Both the clarity and the amplitude of the figure recall the nineteenth-century French painter Ingres, whose image Pasmore included in a later painting of a nude. Here, he was also painting in reaction to a nude by Renoir - 'I thought I'd do the subject, but without the sloppy sentiment. I thought I'd do someone in the family way, just sitting on a bed'.",

The three boxes shown here demonstrate his various technical approaches to achieving their distinctive surfaces. The chequer-board pattern of Untitled (1962) was made by scraping away squares from a mirror, which he then painted black. The smoked effect on the four mirrored squares in the centre was achieved by applying a thin coating to the glass in a vacuum environment. The oval patterns of Untitled (1964) were made by covering the glass with a chemical treatment that cuts off certain bands of light, so that they appear in different colours depending on the viewing angle. Bell later abandoned patterned cubes in favour of plain glass ones, achieving a suffused effect by coating their surfaces  with a thin film of quartz and chromium, as  in Untitled (1967)",

His scenes are designed on computer then transferred to the canvas as schematic drawings. These compositions become increasingly complex, offering the viewer a multitude of vanishing points. Here an ordered geometric system is disrupted by the unchecked dripping of areas of paint. The effects of light are also of particular interest to Ziegler. His use of reflective gold leaf in this work further complicates the painting\u2019s surface and distorts the viewer\u2019s spatial perception.",

    "description": "Vorticism was a short-lived but radical movement that emerged in London immediately before the First World War. 'The vortex is the point of maximum energy', wrote the American poet Ezra Pound, who co-founded the Vorticist journal <i>Blast</i> with Wyndham Lewis in June 1914. The journal, opened with the 'Blast' and 'Bless' manifestos, which celebrate the machine age and Britain as the first industrialised nation. Edward Wadsworth was a contributor and painted this Vorticist abstract composition soon after. With its sharp diagonal lines converging towards a 'nodal point' it exemplifies Pound's definition of the Vortex as 'absorbing all that is around it in a violent whirling - a violent central engulfing'. The group's aggressive rhetoric, angular style and focus on the energy of modern life linked it to Italian Futurism, though it did not share the latter's emphasis on speed and dynamism. Other artists associated with Vorticism included William Roberts, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, CRW Nevinson and David Bomberg. The First World War demonstrated the devastating reality of pitting men against machines and Lewis's attempts to revive the movement in 1919 came to nothing.",

After moving  to London in 1856, Morris and Burne-Jones took over the rooms at Red Lion Square that Rossetti had shared with Walter Deverell (one of the original Pre-Raphaelites).  There were no furnishings, so Morris designed tables, chairs, cabinets and  a settle, which were made by a local carpenter. Rossetti described the results  as 'intensely mediaeval' and encouraged Burne-Jones and Morris to decorate the panels with their own paintings; Rossetti also provided designs himself. This growing interest in individual craftsmanship led  to the formation of Morris & Co in 1861.",

Charles Macklin (c.1699 - 1797) plays Shylock, shown here preparing to plunge his knife into the breast of Antonio, standing on the right, who is played by Matthew Clarke (fl.1755-83). Curiously, the seated figure in scarlet on the extreme left is not an actor, but the actual lord chief justice of the king's bench, Lord Mansfield (1705 - 1793). This unusual mixture of theatre and reality suggests that this portrait group was a special commission, perhaps from Lord Mansfield himself. The painting is unfinished.",

Bourgeois made her first prints in the 1940s and, after a gap of about forty years, returned to printmaking in 1990. Frequently child-like in style, these works portray the events and fantasies of her childhood and adolescence. The scenes include the trauma of birth, the pubescent discovery of the body, the moulding of a daughter by her mother, and the stifling of a daughter by her father.",

He began painting small-scale landscapes around 1853 and soon came under the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites, who were regular exhibitors at the Liverpool Academy. They (Rossetti and Ford Madox Brown in particular) in turn became great admirers of Davis's work. The landscape of Bidston Hill and Bidston Common, now part of Birkenhead, was a popular subject with Davis and other Liverpool Pre-Raphaelites, who appear to have valued it for its un-picturesque, down-to-earth character.",

The flowers themselves were based on an image on a laminated postcard with an illusory \u2018three-dimensional\u2019 effect. The addition of the Andrex toilet paper has been seen as counterbalancing the sentimentality inherent within the genre of painting flowers. It also reflects Hamilton\u2019s fascination with advertising. He has described a lyrical, soft-focus advertisement for Andrex as being \u2018like Watteau in its magical ambiguity\u2019.",

    "description": "Anthony, the hermit saint also known as Anthony the Great, was born in Upper Egypt. On the death of his parents he distributed his property among the poor and retired into the Egyptian desert where he remained in solitude for many years. Thus he is generally regarded as the founder of monasticism. Like other hermits, he was subject to vivid  hallucinations resulting from his austere lifestyle. These visions assume two forms in art, assault by evil spirits or erotic temptation. Roberts's painting focuses on Anthony's temptation by lust. Usually Anthony protects himself with a crucifix or by prayer, but here is seen shielding himself with his arms alone, his prayer books by his side.",

    "description": "Holst was the son of a Latvian music master who settled in London in 1807. In the 1820s he became a pupil of Fuseli, and like him specialised in literary subjects with an emphasis on the macabre and supernatural. This picture seems to relate to the legend of Faust, as retold by the German romantic playwright Goethe in his great poetic drama published in two parts in 1808 and 1832. Faust is a late medieval scholar with a thirst for ultimate knowledge who enters into a pact with the Devil, thereby pledging his soul. The daemonic figure to the left is perhaps identifiable as Faust's companion, Mephistopheles, an agent of Hell, perhaps participating in the witches' Sabbath during Walpurgis Night.",

    "description": "Like 'The Little Country Maid', this painting was executed while the artist lived near Pontoise, north-west of Paris. During the 1880s he became interested in painting rural market scenes, several of which were based on the markets at Pontoise and its neighbouring villages. Such subjects allowed Pissarro to combine the study of the human figure with depictions of outdoor scenes of everyday rural life. Although he wrote to his son Lucien that he wished the painting to have a 'certain naive freshness', hence the light and informal brushstrokes, the central figure of the 'charcuti\u00e8re' was painted from the model and the pose carefully studied.",

    "description": "Flekkefjord is in Norway. It is not known why Gilman twice visited Scandinavia, in 1912 and 1913. It is possible that he went with the painter William Ratcliffe, who had family there. The visits were effectively working expeditions, and Gilman made many studies of towns and scenery. This bridge is painted accurately, but it is likely that Gilman chose the subject thinking of van Gogh's painting of a similar bridge in Provence. Gilman at first rejected Van Gogh's style, but later he came to admire him deeply. His friend Wyndham Lewis recalled that he had a number of Van Gogh postcards on his walls, and when he painted a picture that particularly pleased him, he would hang it next to them.",
